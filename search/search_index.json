Figuring out what the client wants, collaborating in a team, managing complexity, mitigating risks, staying on time and budget, and determining under various constraints when a product is good enough to be shipped are at least equally important topics that often have a significant human component. 17-313 explores these issues while broadly covering the fundamentals of modern software engineering.</p> <p>Assuming reasonably solid programming skills (including unit testing and code-level design), we will explore the following topics:</p> <ul> <li>Process consideration for software development   (How do avoid problems early? When and how much to design? When and how much to test? When and how to involve the customers? Agile methods...)</li> <li>Requirements elicitation, documentation, and evaluation   (How to figure out what the customer really wants? Who else has an interest? How can we measure success objectively? How can we reliably document expectations? ...)</li> <li>Design for quality attributes   (How can we design a system to be able to scale to millions of users? How can we design security into a system? ...)</li> <li>Strategies for quality assurance, including measurement, inspection, and static and dynamic analysis   (What quality assurance strategy is best for a given system? What can we automate and when should we keep humans in the loop? How much testing and what kind of testing should we do? What qualities are important to assure beyond functional correctness? Can we evaluate usability, scalability, reliability, performance? How can we statically guarantee the absence of certain security issues? ...)</li> <li>Empirical methods in software engineering   (How can we measure quality attributes such as performance, security, and reliability? How can we measure how users interact with the system? How can we know whether the difference matters? ...)</li> <li>Time and team management   (How to estimate the duration and costs of a project? How to monitor progress and risks to recognize issues early? How to coordinate developers in a team? How to form and develop teams? How to select and motivate team members? How to deal with team dynamics such as social loafing? ...)</li> <li>Economics of software development   (Business models, outsourcing, open source, ...)</li> </ul> <p>This course has a strong technical focus, and includes assignments with and without programming. Many assignments will also have written components. Students will get experience with team management and modern software-engineering tools. The course puts students on a fast track toward project management positions.</p> <p>Assignments (mostly done in groups) include:</p> <ul> <li>An introduction assignment where individual students will learn to engage with an existing code base.</li> <li>A requirements assignment in which each team will interview stakeholders to elicit and document requirements for a software system.</li> <li>An architecture assignment in which teams will train and deploy an ML model using microservices.</li> <li>A project in which each team contributes to an open source project of their choice. This involves identifying an issue in the existing project, understanding the development process of that project and how to contribute, and actually making a contribution such as fixing a bug or adding a feature. Extra credit will be awarded if the contribution is merged into the project.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"overview/#previous-course-iterations","title":"Previous Course Iterations","text":""},{"location":"overview/#qatar","title":"Qatar","text":"<p>Fall 2022 | Fall 2023 | Fall 2024</p>"},{"location":"overview/#pittsburgh","title":"Pittsburgh","text":"<p>Fall 2020 | Fall 2021 | Fall 2022 | Spring 2023</p>"},{"location":"syllabus/","title":"Syllabus","text":""},{"location":"syllabus/#course-syllabus-and-policies","title":"Course Syllabus and Policies","text":"<p>The course is currently planned to be entirely in person for lectures and recitations.

Even when behavior does not rise to the level of harassment (even if you think you're \"just joking!\"), it can still make people very uncomfortable, and harm their educational and professional career by forcing them to devote mental energy to something other than the material they are trying to learn or the professional successes they are trying to achieve.

This includes making your work publicly available in a way that other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others' access is accidental or incidental to your goals. Beware the privacy settings on your open source accounts!</li> <li>Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help.</li> </ul> <p>If any of your work contains any statement that was not written by you, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Using existing material without proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating.

The PR body should summarize the changes you made and use one of the linking keywords to link the issue that you previously opened (e.g. adding <code>resolves #313</code> will signal to GitHub that this PR resolves issue number 313).</p> Pull Request Guidelines <p>Pull request titles should describe what high-level changes were made to the codebase. Generally, they give a concise summary of all the commit messages.</p> <p>Pull request descriptions should describe what changes have been made in more detail and how the changes have been tested.</p> <p>There will be automated checks that run on your pull request to ensure you meet the requirements of this assignment. Some of them take a while to run, so be sure to check on your pull request periodically to ensure that all these actions pass and everything is working properly!</p> <p>Test Suite Failures</p> <p>If the tests are failing on GitHub but work locally, it may be caused by server overload. Re-running the failing GitHub Action 1-2 times will resolve this.</p> <p>You should ensure that all checks are green.  If all of the actions have passed, you will see a green checkmark next to your pull request.

Miscommunication or the general lack of communication are often the most common causes of team conflict.</p> <p>Team Conflict Example</p> <p>A common conflict in working style is when there are team members who always want to get a headstart on their work, while there are team members who are fine with doing work a few days before the deadline. It causes panic in the former team members, while the latter team members feel frustrated as to why they are being rushed.</p> <p>As such, your first process task of the semester will be creating a teamwork contract with your teammates. It is a 1 - 2 page document containing information that all teammates agree to follow. You should work on the contract with all members present. We recommend that you keep it to around 1 page, 2 page is a hard limit.</p> <p>Additionally, it is more important that you only include statements that the team will adhere to than it is to fulfill the length requirement (quality over quantity!) You do not need to write full sentences (bullet points are okay), but your decisions must be clearly conveyed in the document.</p> <p>You are free to include anything that your team deems necessary, but you should minimally address the following sections:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Expectations How much time is each team member expected to be putting into working on projects? Punctuality? How would your team accommodate when unexpected commitments come up for a team member (e.g. interviews, sickness, competitions)? Do accommodate for the fact that project load can get heavier towards the end of the semester.</p> </li> <li> <p>Communication What platform (s) will your team be using to communicate? What\u2019s the expected time to get a response?  For any communication platforms you decide on, please test that everyone can receive notifications. We highly recommend using apps (Slack, Discord) over browser-based sites.</p> </li> <li> <p>Meeting Schedule When and how will your team meet? What modality would it be?  A strong recommendation would be to set up a recurring 1hr meeting blocked out for the rest of the semester, so that your team does not have to scramble to find a common meeting time each week. Teams that have recurring meetings are generally more successful in the class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responsibilities How will you divide responsibilities for each project? During meetings, who will be in charge of note-taking, organizing &amp; running those meetings?  From past courses, we noticed the natural emergence of a project manager in teams, who ensures the project moves towards completion. We highly suggest that you consider how your team would rotate that role amongst team members over the course of the remaining projects. Throughout the semester, we will ask for documentation of your meeting notes, so be sure to keep them organized (we recommend using a shared Drive folder).</p> </li> <li> <p>Equitable Contribution &amp; Conflict Resolution What are the steps the team would take to address teammates who are contributing too little, and when will the team bring this up to the instructors? What are the steps to bring up and discuss potential teamwork issues?  The first thing the staff will ask the student when they mention that they are facing team issues is if they have followed the steps on their team contract.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Feel free to seek the assistance of TAs and instructors in drafting this document.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>We will ask you to reference, reflect upon, and refine this document throughout this semester, and we will evaluate your team's process strategies and interactions through what you outline in this contract. Please ensure that everyone on your team thoroughly discusses each of the above sections and agree with the final decisions.</p> <p>Once you have completed the contract itself, have all members sign and date the document as an indicator that all members have read the document and agreed to uphold all outlined items. Then, save the file as a PDF and upload it to Gradescope. Only one team member needs to make the submission; they can then add the rest of the teammates as group members for a group submission.</p> <p>We also highly recommend that you bookmark the teamwork contract in your team\u2019s Slack channel.</p>"},{"location":"projects/P2/1_teamprocess/#project-planning-35-pts","title":"Project Planning (35 pts)","text":"<p>Before your team jumps into development, you must first determine what features to implement.

To integrate this as a microservice NodeBB interacts with, this could be done by rewriting the API request when a user is created (a POST request to <code>/user</code>; details about this request are in <code>public/openapi/write/users.yaml</code>). We reach out to the CMU directory microservice and query the username that is passed in; if we are able to find it, we update the user metadata (<code>data</code>) in the <code>create</code> function within <code>src/user/create.js</code>. This could also be done by listening for the event that is fired when creating an event (<code>action:user.create</code>), and adding these additional attributes after that point. <code>Ctrl-Shift-F</code> is your friend here; if you're struggling, look back at lecture 2 and recitation 4 to get some tips on how to work through NodeBB's codebase.</li> <li>Quality Requirements:     Additionally provide a concise, prioritized list of the overall quality requirements you considered in arguing for the integration of the feature into the system and a short justification for each.
