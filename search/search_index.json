Overview \u00b6 Successful software projects require more than just technical expertise. Figuring out what the client wants, collaborating in a team, managing complexity, mitigating risks, staying on time and budget, and determining under various constraints when a product is good enough to be shipped are at least equally important topics that often have a significant human component. 17-313 explores these issues while broadly covering the fundamentals of modern software engineering. Assuming reasonably solid programming skills (including unit testing and code-level design), we will explore the following topics: Process consideration for software development (How do avoid problems early? When and how much to design? When and how much to test? When and how to involve the customers? Agile methods...) Requirements elicitation, documentation, and evaluation (How to figure out what the customer really wants? Who else has an interest? How can we measure success objectively? How can we reliably document expectations? ...) Design for quality attributes (How can we design a system to be able to scale to millions of users? How can we design security into a system? ...) Strategies for quality assurance, including measurement, inspection, and static and dynamic analysis (What quality assurance strategy is best for a given system? What can we automate and when should we keep humans in the loop? How much testing and what kind of testing should we do? What qualities are important to assure beyond functional correctness?

How to coordinate developers in a team? How to form and develop teams? How to select and motivate team members? How to deal with team dynamics such as social loafing? ...) Economics of software development (Business models, outsourcing, open source, ...) This course has a strong technical focus, and includes assignments with and without programming. Many assignments will also have written components. Students will get experience with team management and modern software-engineering tools. The course puts students on a fast track toward project management positions. Assignments (mostly done in groups) include: An introduction assignment where individual students will learn to engage with an existing code base. A requirements assignment in which each team will interview stakeholders to elicit and document requirements for a software system. An architecture assignment in which teams will train and deploy an ML model using microservices. A project in which each team contributes to an open source project of their choice. This involves identifying an issue in the existing project, understanding the development process of that project and how to contribute, and actually making a contribution such as fixing a bug or adding a feature. Extra credit will be awarded if the contribution is merged into the project.

Most office hours will be in person, but some may be held over Zoom as well. The course uses Gradescope for homework submission, grading; slides and handouts are posted here on the course website; GitHub is used to coordinate group work. We also use Slack for communication and group work: check your email during the first week of classes for the Slack sign up link. Prerequisites \u00b6 This class has a pre-requisite of 15-122 or 15-121. If you have not taken those classes, but you think you have similar experiences, please reach out to the instructors. Communication \u00b6 The primary form of communication within this course is through Slack. We will make announcements through a dedicated channel in Slack, and also provide channels for homework clarifications and team-based communication. As such, we highly recommend that students install Slack on their phones / desktop with notifications enabled. The instructor, TA, and CAs will also hold weekly office hours to provide support with course materials and projects. You can find the office hours schedule updated weekly here on the course website. You can contact the course staff via both Slack and email. Your team will also have assigned CAs as your primary point of contact for additional support with assignment or recitation-related questions. When contacting instructors or your designated CAs, please email/message the instructor, TA, and designated CA at the same time. Teamwork \u00b6 Teamwork is an essential part of this course. Most projects are done in teams of 3-5 students. Teams will be assigned by the instructors and stay together for multiple projects. Most projects have a component that is graded for the entire group and a component that is graded individually. Being able to address team issues in software projects is one of the core learning objectives of this class. Guidance on teamwork, reflection, and conflict resolution will be provided throughout the semester and are an essential component of the class. We expect significant efforts in attempting to address the team issues before asking instructors and teaching/course assistants to step in. However, we will always be available to provide advice on how to navigate these issues. Textbook \u00b6 Various readings throughout the semester are available online or through the library; we do not have a single textbook but rather assemble readings from different sources. As optional supplementary reading consider the (freely available) Software Engineering at Google, Lessons Learned from Programming Over Time . Devices in Lecture and Recitation \u00b6 Research shows that using devices on non-class related activities harms both the device user's learning, and other students' learning as well. Therefore, in general, we do not allow the use of devices during lecture. If you genuinely use your laptop for class-related activities (note-taking, etc), tell us, and we will make an exception. However, we ask that if you do so, you are careful to keep your devices in note-taking mode (and don\u2019t stray to Facebook, homework, etc). In addition, you will be required to sit in the back row of the lecture to minimize the impact your screen has on others. Note that recitation activities will often involve devices, so please do bring your laptop! Assessment \u00b6 Evaluation will be based on the following distribution: 60% projects, 20% midterm, 20% participation (including lecture exercises, pre-lecture reading quizzes, and recitation exercises). Project Points Breakdown (tentative) Project # Days Given Points % of HW grade % of total grade 1 11 100 10% 6% 2 35 275 27.5% 16.5% 3 11 100 10% 6% 4 14 125 12.5% 7.5% 5 27 400 40% 24% TOTAL 1000 100% 60% Regrades \u00b6 Regrade requests can be submitted via Gradescope. The regrade period is open for one week after grades have been released for a particular assignment. Late Work Policy \u00b6 Participation \u00b6 Participation points in this class are earned through a series of pre-lecture reading assignments, lecture activities, and recitations. To accommodate for life's uncertainties (e.g. health issues, scheduling conflicts), you will automatically get full points for up to four missed participation activities to account for any absences. You do not need to email instructors individually for one-off absences of this sort. There will be no make-ups for participation points, but you are strongly encouraged to come to office hours to learn or review the materials that you may have missed. If you find yourself in a situation that calls for an extended absence, please have your academic advisor reach out to the instructors, and they will work to find a solution on a case by case basis. Projects \u00b6 Late work will receive feedback but no credit. Due to heavy emphasis on planning & teamwork in this course there are no late days; we expect that you anticipate unexpected events in your planning , and coordinate with your teammates when they arise. Exceptions to this policy will be made only in extraordinary circumstances, almost always involving a family or medical emergency, with your academic advisor or the Dean of Student Affairs requesting the exception on your behalf. Time Management \u00b6 This is a 12-unit course, and it is our intention to manage it so that you spend close to 12 hours a week on the course, on average. In general, 4 hours/week will be spent in lectures & recitation and 8 hours on readings and projects. Notice that most projects are done in groups, so please account for the overhead and decreased time flexibility that comes with group work. Throughout the semester, please feel free to give the course staff feedback on how much time the course is taking for you. Writing \u00b6 Describing tradeoffs among decisions and communication with less technical stakeholders are key aspects of this class. Most projects have a component that requires discussing issues in written form or reflecting about experiences. To practice writing skills, the Academic Resource Center (ARC) offers individually-tailored English language support for students, along with workshops. The instructors are also happy to provide additional guidance if requested. Policy on use of Generative AI for Writing \u00b6 You may use generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT or CoPilot for assisting in code development or writing responses to homework questions, unless the question specifically prohibits it . However, any use of AI comes with two caveats: (1) you must clearly indicate the use of such technology (and name the tool) in every homework question or source code file where an AI tool was used as a form of attribution, just as you would if you had taken help from a friend; (2) you are liable for factually inaccurate answers or unspecific rambling produced by AI tools; it is your responsibility to edit AI-produced content before submitting it for class purposes. Professionalism \u00b6 Your classmates are your colleagues. This is particularly true in this course, where we aim to provide you with principles, practices, tools, and paradigms that will enable you to be an effective, real-world Software Engineer. We ask that you treat one another like the professionals you are and that you are preparing to be. To that end, we will not tolerate harassment in this class. We define harassment as unwelcome or hostile behavior of an ad hominem nature, i.e., that focuses not on ideas but on people and identity. This includes offensive verbal or written comments in reference to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of class meetings, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment is against the law and we have no tolerance for it, and neither does the university. Even when behavior does not rise to the level of harassment (even if you think you're \"just joking!\"), it can still make people very uncomfortable, and harm their educational and professional career by forcing them to devote mental energy to something other than the material they are trying to learn or the professional successes they are trying to achieve. However, we expect that we do not need to threaten you to earn your respect on this matter: we simply ask that you treat one another like professionals, in the most positive sense. This has two implications: If you feel someone is violating these principles (for example, with a joke that could be interpreted as sexist, racist, or exclusionary), and you feel you have the standing to do so, speak up! Do not be a bystander to unprofessional behavior. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, and/or if the behavior persists, send a private email to the course instructors or set up a meeting with us to discuss the matter. We will preserve your anonymity. We, the course staff, are committed to affording you the same respect we ask you to afford one another. If you feel that we are not doing so, we hope you will feel comfortable either telling us so directly, or approaching another one of the course staff with your concerns. (Thank you to Shriram Krishnamurthi and Evan Peck for sharing their own policies, from which we drew inspiration for this one.) Academic Honesty and Collaboration \u00b6 The usual policies apply, especially the University Policy on Academic Integrity . Many of the projects will be done in groups. We expect that group members collaborate with one another, but that groups work independently from one another, not exchanging results with other groups. Within groups, we expect that you are honest about your contribution to the group's work. This implies not taking credit for others' work and not covering for team members that have not contributed to the team. Otherwise, our expectations regarding academic honesty and collaboration for group work are the same as for individual work, substituting elevated to the level of \"group.\" The course includes both individual projects and individual components of group projects . Although your solutions for individual parts will be based on the content produced for the group component (e.g. written reflections on lessons learned), we treat individual components of group projects as equivalent to individual projects overall, and expect you to complete such components independently of your groupmates. The rest of this academic honesty and collaboration content is taken from the policy used in 17-214: \"You may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was written by another student, or was developed together with another student, or was copied from another unauthorized source such as the Internet. You may not look at another student's solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may you knowingly give your solution to another student or leave your solution where another student can see it. Here are some examples of behavior that are inappropriate: Copying or retyping, or referring to, files or parts of files (such as source code, written text, or unit tests) from another person or source (whether in final or draft form, regardless of the permissions set on the associated files) while producing your own. This is true even if your version includes minor modifications such as style or variable name changes or minor logic modifications. Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do not acknowledge on your solution. Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources. Lying to course staff. Giving copies of work to others, or allowing someone else to copy or refer to your code or written assignment to produce their own, either in draft or final form. This includes making your work publicly available in a way that other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others' access is accidental or incidental to your goals. Beware the privacy settings on your open source accounts! Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help. If any of your work contains any statement that was not written by you, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Using existing material without proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question about whether the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. We will be using automated systems to detect software plagiarism. It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the assignments, lectures, lecture notes; to give help or receive help in using the computer systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other facilities; or to discuss ideas at a very high level, without referring to or producing code. Any violation of this policy is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating (including plagiarism) will be a zero grade for the whole assignment. Cheating incidents will also be reported through University channels, with possible additional disciplinary action (see the above-linked University Policy on Academic Integrity). If you have any question about how this policy applies in a particular situation, ask the instructors or TAs for clarification.\" Note that the instructors respect honesty in these (and indeed most!) situations. Accommodations \u00b6 Carnegie Mellon University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. To access accommodation services you are expected to initiate the request and submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form to the office of Health & Wellness or CaPS-Q. In order to receive services/accommodations, verification of a disability is required as recommended in writing by a doctor, licensed psychologist or psycho-educational specialist.

This is particularly true in this course, where we aim to provide you with principles, practices, tools, and paradigms that will enable you to be an effective, real-world Software Engineer. We ask that you treat one another like the professionals you are and that you are preparing to be. To that end, we will not tolerate harassment in this class. We define harassment as unwelcome or hostile behavior of an ad hominem nature, i.e., that focuses not on ideas but on people and identity. This includes offensive verbal or written comments in reference to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of class meetings, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment is against the law and we have no tolerance for it, and neither does the university. Even when behavior does not rise to the level of harassment (even if you think you're \"just joking!\"), it can still make people very uncomfortable, and harm their educational and professional career by forcing them to devote mental energy to something other than the material they are trying to learn or the professional successes they are trying to achieve. However, we expect that we do not need to threaten you to earn your respect on this matter: we simply ask that you treat one another like professionals, in the most positive sense. This has two implications: If you feel someone is violating these principles (for example, with a joke that could be interpreted as sexist, racist, or exclusionary), and you feel you have the standing to do so, speak up! Do not be a bystander to unprofessional behavior. If you do not feel comfortable doing so, and/or if the behavior persists, send a private email to the course instructors or set up a meeting with us to discuss the matter. We will preserve your anonymity. We, the course staff, are committed to affording you the same respect we ask you to afford one another. If you feel that we are not doing so, we hope you will feel comfortable either telling us so directly, or approaching another one of the course staff with your concerns. (Thank you to Shriram Krishnamurthi and Evan Peck for sharing their own policies, from which we drew inspiration for this one.)","title":"Professionalism"},{"location":"syllabus/#academic-honesty-and-collaboration","text":"The usual policies apply, especially the University Policy on Academic Integrity . Many of the projects will be done in groups. We expect that group members collaborate with one another, but that groups work independently from one another, not exchanging results with other groups. Within groups, we expect that you are honest about your contribution to the group's work. This implies not taking credit for others' work and not covering for team members that have not contributed to the team. Otherwise, our expectations regarding academic honesty and collaboration for group work are the same as for individual work, substituting elevated to the level of \"group.\" The course includes both individual projects and individual components of group projects . Although your solutions for individual parts will be based on the content produced for the group component (e.g. written reflections on lessons learned), we treat individual components of group projects as equivalent to individual projects overall, and expect you to complete such components independently of your groupmates. The rest of this academic honesty and collaboration content is taken from the policy used in 17-214: \"You may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was written by another student, or was developed together with another student, or was copied from another unauthorized source such as the Internet. You may not look at another student's solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may you knowingly give your solution to another student or leave your solution where another student can see it. Here are some examples of behavior that are inappropriate: Copying or retyping, or referring to, files or parts of files (such as source code, written text, or unit tests) from another person or source (whether in final or draft form, regardless of the permissions set on the associated files) while producing your own. This is true even if your version includes minor modifications such as style or variable name changes or minor logic modifications. Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do not acknowledge on your solution. Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources. Lying to course staff. Giving copies of work to others, or allowing someone else to copy or refer to your code or written assignment to produce their own, either in draft or final form. This includes making your work publicly available in a way that other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others' access is accidental or incidental to your goals. Beware the privacy settings on your open source accounts! Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help. If any of your work contains any statement that was not written by you, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Using existing material without proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question about whether the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. We will be using automated systems to detect software plagiarism. It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the assignments, lectures, lecture notes; to give help or receive help in using the computer systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other facilities; or to discuss ideas at a very high level, without referring to or producing code. Any violation of this policy is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating (including plagiarism) will be a zero grade for the whole assignment. Cheating incidents will also be reported through University channels, with possible additional disciplinary action (see the above-linked University Policy on Academic Integrity). If you have any question about how this policy applies in a particular situation, ask the instructors or TAs for clarification.\" Note that the instructors respect honesty in these (and indeed most!) situations.","title":"Academic Honesty and Collaboration"},{"location":"syllabus/#accommodations","text":"Carnegie Mellon University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities.

Development Environment \u00b6 We provide an official VS Code DevContainer for this project. It gives you a fully configured environment and makes it easier for the course staff to help you. Support Policy We will only guarantee support for the DevContainer setup. You may choose to install and run the project natively, but you will be responsible for resolving environment issues. Prerequisites \u00b6 Docker Visual Studio Code with the Dev Containers extension Ubuntu WSL2 (if using Windows) Installation \u00b6 Clone your fork to your machine. If you are using Windows, you should use git from inside WSL2 . git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/NodeBB.git cd NodeBB Windows WSL2 Warning For Windows WSL2 users, you should store your project files on the same operating system as the tools you plan to use . When it comes to cloning the NodeBB repository, it means that you should clone it in: the Linux file system root directory: \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\<user name>\\ NOT the Windows file system root directory: /mnt/c/Users/<user name>/$ or C:\\Users\\<user name>\\ You can use % cd ~ to access the Linux home directory, then clone the repository there. Open the repository in VS Code, then choose \u201cReopen in Container\u201d when prompted (bottom-right). Alternatively, open the Command Palette ( Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P ) and run \u201cDev Containers: Reopen in Container\u201d . The container will take a few minutes to build the first time. Confirm that installation was successful by checking the node and npm versions from the integrated terminal: Setup your NodeBB installation via the integrated terminal using the command below. This will use the environment variables from the DevContainer (specified in .devcontainer/devcontainer.json ). As part of the process, an admin account ( admin ) will be created with password password123! . ./nodebb setup Finally, you should install all of the NodeBB development dependencies via: npm install Launch \u00b6 Start the server from the integrated terminal in VSCode: nodebb start You should be able to navigate to http://localhost:4567 and see the main forum page, as shown below. NodeBB listens on port 4567 in the container and is forwarded to localhost:4567 on your machine (configured by the DevContainer). If you need to change the host port (e.g., to avoid a conflict), use the Ports tab at the bottom of VS Code and modify the Forwarded Address : Warning In this class, we expect students to first try debugging errors on their own; this includes following stack traces, searching up error strings and unfamiliar outputs, etc. If you get stuck, or if installing and running NodeBB is taking more than a few hours, stop and ask for help on Slack! Take some time to click through the pages and explore the different features that NodeBB has to offer. To shut down the server: nodebb stop You can also use the --help option to learn more about other nodebb commands. nodebb --help Lint and Test \u00b6 When working on an existing codebase, especially in a collaborative setting, we want to ensure that none of our changes introduce unexpected bugs or issues for other developers. To fulfill these goals, we often use different tools to help us evaluate our code. Luckily, NodeBB is already packaged with a number of neat tools! You can run the linter and test suite using the following two commands: npm run lint npm run test The first time you run the above commands, you may have to run npm install to fetch dependencies and also edit your config.json file to add test dependencies. See the FAQ page for more. After the test suite finishes running, NodeBB will also generate a code coverage report . This report gives you measurements with regards to what percentage of the codebase is covered by the test suite. Open the index.html file in the coverage folder to see the full report. Coverage Report As this is an existing codebase with a decently-sized test suite, you should expect to see a relatively high percentage of coverage , i.e. the majority of the bars/cells displayed should be green. If you are seeing a lot of red bars, it may mean that the test suite was not run properly. Double-check that all of the tests passed and that there were no failures. More on Analysis Tools A linter is a tool that directly analyzes your source code for common errors. A test suite is a set of test cases that you write for a software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviors; our testing tool provides a framework to structure our test cases, runs the test suite, and generates a report of which tests pass/fail. We will do a more in-depth exploration of analysis tools later in the course. For now, just know that these tools exist for you to use in evaluating your code. Deliverable: Build Checkpoint (5 pts) \u00b6 Upon completing the above steps, take screenshots of the home page of NodeBB, and the coverage report generated by the coverage tool opened in your browser. Be sure the URL is clearly visible in both screenshots (i.e. localhost:4567 and the file path to your coverage file), so we can confirm that you have everything running locally.

The team has noticed an accumulation of maintainability issues detected by Qlty , a multi-language code quality tool. Qlty detects \u201ccode smells\u201d such as high function complexity, too many parameters, deep nesting, and duplicated code. Your task is to remove one or more Qlty-reported issues by refactoring code and validating that your change takes effect within the NodeBB codebase. Prerequisites \u00b6 Onboarding Materials \u00b6 Before jumping into the codebase, please review the course syllabus and be sure you have access to each of the following: Course Slack - Gradescope If you run into any trouble accessing the above or have any questions, reach out to the instructors. Git & GitHub \u00b6 In this project and throughout the rest of this course, you will be expected to work extensively with Git and GitHub. Specifically for this project, you should be familiar with: Forking/cloning GitHub repositories Understanding general Git flow - pulling, branching, adding, committing, pushing, merging Creating GitHub Issues and using related features (labels, assignees, milestones) Creating GitHub Pull Requests and using related features (linking to issues) Creating GitHub Project Boards If you are not familiar with any of these steps, you are highly recommended to first complete Recitation 2 - Git, GitHub, as it will cover the standards we are expecting in this class (which you will be graded upon). Refer to the Resources & Documentation section if needed. Qlty \u00b6 Qlty is a multi-language static analysis tool that supports linting, scanning, and auto-formatting across a large number of languages and technologies, including Javascript. For this assignment, you will locally install and configure the Qlty command-line tool to identify maintainability issues within the codebase. To get started, you will need to install Qlty on your machine: https://github.com/qltysh/qlty?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-start. If you are using the DevContainer, everything should already be installed for you. To use Qlty to show all of the code smells within the project, you should run: qlty smells --all Note that, by default, Qlty only analyzes the files that you've modified since your last commit. --all tells Qlty to scan the entire codebase. This will a large list of issues and likely fill up your terminal with lots of code snippets. To make it easier to find which files have issues, you can disable code snippets in the output via the --no-snippet option: qlty smells --all --no-snippet Once you've narrowed in on a particular file, you can produce a list of smells for just that file as follows: qlty smells public/src/path/to/file.js Tasks \u00b6 GitHub Issue (20 pts) \u00b6 First, choose a single Qlty-reported \u201csmell\u201d in a JavaScript file and open a GitHub issue in the class repository to declare which file and issue you will be working on. For the task, the file must: Be a Javascript file. Be in the src/ or public/src/ directory. Be a file that no one else in the class has picked and created an issue for. We expect you to look through existing open issues, if any, to avoid duplication. If you really cannot find a unique file because you are late to the game, then you may pick a file that has an open issue, but identify a different Qlty-reported smell in the same file. Reference the other issue in your description to distinguish yourself (e.g., \"this is different from #124 because...\"). The Qlty issue you pick should be a maintainability smell (e.g., high function complexity, too many parameters, deep nesting, or duplicated code) that requires real code restructuring. Title the task appropriately, such as Refactoring code in <file name> , and mention the file name in the description. Use the full file path ( src/../xx.js ) in the title and description to avoid ambiguity. Additionally, include in the description: A copy/paste or screenshot of the relevant Qlty output (from qlty smells --all ). A brief explanation of the issue you will address. Issue Guidelines Issues titles should provide a high-level overview of what the problem is (e.g. \"Navbar button UI bugs\" , \"Unexpected registration validation errors\" ). Sometimes, issues are used to propose new features (e.g. \"Add CSV export feature\" ). Issue descriptions should then elaborate on the title. For feature-level bugs, this may include providing information about how to reproduce the bug; for codebase-level changes, you can name specific files. Then, assign yourself to the Issue by leaving a comment that says \"I would like to work on this please!\" You should soon see another comment by the github-actions bot informing you that you have been successfully assigned to this issue. Why Bot Assignment? You might be curious as to why we are using a GitHub bot instead of directly assigning yourself to the issue. As you aren\u2019t officially recognized as a collaborator of CMU-313/NodeBB, GitHub adds some restrictions to your permissions for security purposes, including not being able to assign yourself to an issue. Hence, we are using a bot to work around these restrictions. This is similar to how you would request issues on an Open Source project! For future projects, you will have full control over these GitHub features such as managing assignees, adding labels, creating milestones, and more. Code Refactoring and Validation (10 pts) \u00b6 For this task, you will focus on refactoring the code and removing the corresponding Qlty issue(s) from your chosen file. As part of the task, you must validate your changes for one Qlty-reported smell by re-running Qlty locally. Back in your own fork, create a feature branch and implement the changes needed to address the chosen Qlty issue(s). You should start with the following steps: Review the Qlty smells for the file (via qlty smells --all ). Identify the necessary code changes to address the chosen smell. Implement the changes and ensure that they do not introduce new Qlty warnings or issues. Run the linter and test suite to ensure your changes pass all checks (via npm run lint and npm run test ). We also want you to manually test your changes in a running NodeBB instance. The purpose is to trigger the refactored code's execution from the user interface (UI) with the following steps: Within your implementation, add a print statement (e.g., console.log(YOUR_NAME) ) immediately before, after, or in the middle of your refactored code. Restart the NodeBB instance and watch its logs via ./nodebb log . Perform any necessary UI operations that execute the refactored code (e.g., clicking buttons for an action) Take a screenshot of these logs and include it in your written report, along with a brief explanation of the steps you took to trigger the code. Remove the temporary print statement before committing your final code. GitHub Pull Request (25 pts) \u00b6 As you work, be sure to periodically commit your changes. Your commit message(s) must clearly describe what is changing. If you\u2019d like, you can also make use of branching and pull requests in your own repository to practice working with GitHub. Branch and Commit Guidelines Branch names should be short and provide a description of what you will be doing on that branch (e.g. \"fix-header-sizing-issue\" , \"fix-multiple-dialog-bug\" , \"add-sorting-feature\" ). When working with others, you can also append your username to signal which branches are yours (e.g. \"313ta/add-sorting-feature\" ). Commits should start with a verb and provide a description of what they are doing to the codebase (e.g. \"Remove faulty condition from getCustomerDetails\" , \"Fix failing CompositeTestCase\" , \"Fix issue #21\" ). Once you are satisfied, open a pull request from your personal branch back to the class repository. Similar to the Issue, your PR title should mention the full path of the file you\u2019ve changed. The PR body should summarize the changes you made and use one of the linking keywords to link the issue that you previously opened (e.g. adding resolves #313 will signal to GitHub that this PR resolves issue number 313). Pull Request Guidelines Pull request titles should describe what high-level changes were made to the codebase. Generally, they give a concise summary of all the commit messages. Pull request descriptions should describe what changes have been made in more detail and how the changes have been tested. There will be automated checks that run on your pull request to ensure you meet the requirements of this assignment. Some of them take a while to run, so be sure to check on your pull request periodically to ensure that all these actions pass and everything is working properly! Test Suite Failures If the tests are failing on GitHub but work locally, it may be caused by server overload. Re-running the failing GitHub Action 1-2 times will resolve this. You should ensure that all checks are green. If all of the actions have passed, you will see a green checkmark next to your pull request. This signals that you have completed the implementation aspect of this assignment! \u2705 Written Assignment (40 pts) \u00b6 After you have completed all of the above tasks, we will ask you some questions relevant to the NodeBB project and the course syllabus . Fill out and submit the HW1 Written Assignment available on Gradescope.

Understanding these technologies will help you succeed not just in this assignment, but throughout your software engineering career. Learning Goals By the end of this guide, you should understand: What each tool does and why we use it How the tools work together in a development workflow The benefits of modern development practices Common terminology used in software engineering Core Technologies \u00b6 Docker \u00b6 What it is : Docker creates \"containers\" - lightweight, portable environments that package your application with all its dependencies. Think of it like : Shipping containers that work the same way on any truck, train, or ship. A Docker container runs the same way on any computer. Why we use it : Consistency : Everyone runs the exact same environment Isolation : Your project won't conflict with other software on your machine Reproducibility : Eliminates \"it works on my machine\" problems Easy setup : Pre-configured with all necessary tools Example : Instead of manually installing Node.js, Redis, and configuring everything, Docker gives you a pre-built environment ready to go. Dev Containers \u00b6 What it is : A VS Code extension that uses Docker to create development environments automatically. How it works : When you open a project with a .devcontainer folder, VS Code asks if you want to \"Reopen in Container\" - this builds and launches a Docker container with all development tools pre-installed. Benefits : Zero manual setup : No need to install Node.js, databases, or other dependencies Identical environments : Everyone in the class has the exact same setup Fast onboarding : Get coding in minutes, not hours Consistent experience : Course staff can better help you since we all use the same environment Workflow : Clone repository Open in VS Code Click \"Reopen in Container\" Start coding! VS Code \u00b6 What it is : A popular code editor (like Microsoft Word, but designed for writing code). Key features : Syntax highlighting : Colors code to make it easier to read IntelliSense : Auto-completion and error detection Integrated terminal : Command line built right into the editor Extensions : Add functionality like Dev Containers, Git tools, etc. Debugging : Step through code to find and fix bugs Why developers love it : Free, fast, powerful, and works with almost any programming language. Web Development Technologies \u00b6 NodeBB \u00b6 What it is : Forum software (like Reddit, Discord, or traditional bulletin boards) built for modern web browsers. Key features : Real-time messaging : Updates appear instantly without page refreshes User accounts : Registration, profiles, permissions Categories & topics : Organized discussion threads Responsive design : Works on desktop and mobile Plugin system : Extensible with third-party add-ons Built with : Node.js, Express.js, WebSockets, and either Redis, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL Why we chose it : Real-world, actively maintained project with complex features that demonstrate software engineering challenges. Node.js and npm \u00b6 Node.js : JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript on servers (not just in web browsers). Traditional : JavaScript only ran in browsers Node.js : JavaScript can now power servers, build tools, and desktop applications npm (Node Package Manager) : Like an \"app store\" for JavaScript code libraries. Common commands : npm install - Downloads all packages your project needs npm run [script] - Runs predefined commands (like npm run test ) npm start - Typically starts your application Package.json : File that lists what packages your project depends on, like a shopping list for npm. Localhost and Ports \u00b6 Localhost : Your own computer acting as a web server. http://localhost:4567 means \"show me the website running on my computer, port 4567\" Port numbers : Like apartment numbers - different services use different ports Port 4567 : NodeBB's default port (you can change this if needed) Why localhost : Lets you test your application privately before sharing it with the world. Quality Assurance Tools \u00b6 Linting \u00b6 What it is : A tool that analyzes your code for style issues and potential errors. Like : Grammar and spell-check for code. What it catches : Missing semicolons Unused variables Inconsistent formatting (spaces vs tabs) Potential logic errors Style guide violations Example : // Linter would flag these issues: var unusedVariable = 'hello' // unused variable console . log ( 'world' ) // inconsistent spacing Why important : Keeps code clean, readable, and consistent across team members. Command : npm run lint Testing \u00b6 What it is : Automated checks that verify your code works correctly. Types : Unit tests : Test individual functions in isolation Integration tests : Test how different parts work together End-to-end tests : Test the entire application flow Example : // A simple test test ( 'addition works correctly' , () => { expect ( 2 + 2 ). toBe ( 4 ); }); Why crucial : Catch bugs early : Before users encounter them Prevent regressions : Ensure new changes don't break existing features Enable refactoring : Safely improve code knowing tests will catch mistakes Command : npm run test Code Coverage \u00b6 What it is : Measurement of what percentage of your code is executed by tests. Coverage report : Visual display showing: Green lines : Covered by tests Red lines : Not covered by tests Percentage : Overall coverage score Good coverage : Generally 70-90% for most projects (NodeBB should show high coverage). Why it matters : Higher coverage = more confidence that your code works correctly. Important note : 100% coverage doesn't mean perfect code - quality of tests matters more than quantity. Development Workflow \u00b6 Version Control with Git \u00b6 Git : Tool that tracks changes to files over time, like a \"save game\" system for code. Key concepts : Repository (repo) : Folder containing all project files + change history Commit : Snapshot of your code at a specific point in time Branch : Parallel version of your code for working on features Merge : Combining changes from different branches GitHub : Website that hosts Git repositories online and adds collaboration features. Detailed Git Commands For a comprehensive reference of Git commands specific to this project, see our Git Commands Reference Guide . Forking and Cloning \u00b6 Forking : Making your own copy of someone else's repository on GitHub. Original repo \u2192 Fork to your account \u2192 You can make changes safely Cloning : Downloading a repository from GitHub to your computer. git clone <url> downloads the code so you can work on it locally Why fork first : So you can make changes without affecting the original project. Development vs Production Environments \u00b6 Development environment : Where you write and test code Usually on localhost Can break things safely Has debugging tools enabled Production environment : Where real users access your application Public website with real domain name Must be stable and fast Has monitoring and security features Why separate : You can experiment and make mistakes in development without affecting real users. Modern Development Practices \u00b6 Containerization Benefits \u00b6 Traditional development problems : \"It works on my machine\" syndrome Hours spent configuring environments Version conflicts between projects Difficult to onboard new team members Container solutions : Consistency : Same environment for everyone Isolation : Projects don't interfere with each other Portability : Works on Windows, Mac, Linux Quick setup : Ready to code in minutes Automated Quality Checks \u00b6 Why automate : Consistency : Tools don't have \"off days\" like humans Speed : Check entire codebase in seconds Catch issues early : Before they become expensive to fix Enable collaboration : Maintain code quality as team grows Industry standard : Most professional projects use linting, testing, and continuous integration. Real-time Development \u00b6 Hot reload : Changes appear in browser automatically when you save files. Live debugging : See errors and logs in real-time. Instant feedback : Know immediately if something breaks. Why it matters : Faster development cycle means more time for building features, less time waiting. Common Issues and Solutions \u00b6 Container Problems \u00b6 Problem : \"Reopen in Container\" option doesn't appear Solution : Ensure .devcontainer folder is at project root level Problem : Container build fails Solution : Check Docker is running, try \"Dev Containers: Rebuild Container\" Port Conflicts \u00b6 Problem : localhost:4567 doesn't work Solutions : Check NodeBB is running ( ./nodebb start ) Try different port in VS Code Ports tab Restart container if ports are conflicted Test and Lint Failures \u00b6 Problem : Tests fail on first run Solution : Run npm install to fetch dependencies, check config.json setup Problem : Linter shows many errors Solution : This is normal for learning - fix one error at a time, ask for help if overwhelmed Connection to Professional Development \u00b6 Industry Relevance \u00b6 These aren't just academic exercises - they're industry standard practices: Docker : Used by companies like Netflix, Uber, Spotify for deploying applications Testing : Critical for companies like banks, healthcare, aerospace where bugs have serious consequences Linting : Standard at Google, Facebook, Microsoft for maintaining code quality CI/CD : How companies like Amazon deploy code hundreds of times per day safely Career Preparation \u00b6 Understanding these tools prepares you for: Internships : You'll recognize and use similar tools Job interviews : Demonstrate knowledge of professional development practices Open source contributions : Most projects use similar workflows Personal projects : Build applications the \"right way\" from the start What's Next \u00b6 Now that you understand these foundational concepts, you're ready to: Complete the Build Checkpoint : Set up your environment with confidence Explore NodeBB : Navigate the codebase with better understanding Use the tools effectively : Leverage linting, testing, and debugging Collaborate successfully : Work with teammates using professional practices Remember: If any step takes more than a few hours, ask for help! These tools are designed to make development faster and easier, not to create roadblocks.

After this exercise, students should be able to use Git and GitHub for their teamwork in this course and other projects. Students should know about the Git workflow and how to collaborate with other developers in their projects. Note This exercise is optional and is meant to provide a sandbox environment for students who want to practice using Git and GitHub tools. Students should use their own discretion on whether this exercise is helpful or necessary to support their learning. Prerequisites \u00b6 You have a GitHub account You have Git installed You have Python 3 installed You know Git Basics Forking a Repository \u00b6 Start by forking this repository to your personal account by clicking the Fork button at the top of the page. Then, under the General tab in Settings , check the \"Issues\" checkbox in the \"Features\" section to enable the issues pane for your repository. Clone the repository onto your local machine. Running a GitHub Action Workflow \u00b6 On GitHub, click the Actions tab, enable workflows by clicking the green button, then select the \"Python Application\" workflow. Click on the \"Run workflow\" dropdown. Double-check that the selected Branch is main , then click the \"Run workflow\" button. This manually will run the GitHub workflow that tests the Fibonacci function in fib.py using test_fib.py . Once the action has finished running, click into the workflow and select \"build\". You should notice the action failing, meaning the test cases failed and our main branch is broken! Let's walk through the process to fix these errors. Tip In practice, you should not merge code into the main branch that could cause it to fail. This way, we can ensure that all the code on the main branch represents our most recent fully-working product. Setting up a Project Board \u00b6 Project boards are a great way to track development. Although there are many nice external tools such as Trello or Jira, GitHub provides their own project boards for us to use with great integration support of their other features. Under the Projects tab, create a new project with the \"Board\" template. After the board has been created, go back to the Projects tab and link the project board to the repository. Creating Issues \u00b6 Check back on the build output in the Actions tab and take a look at which test cases are failing. Take note of the names of each test case - they should give you a hint as to what the bugs may be! Under the Issues tab, create an issue for each failing test case. Issue Guidelines Issues titles should provide a high-level overview of what the problem is (e.g. \"Navbar button UI bugs\" , \"Unexpected registration validation errors\" ). Sometimes, issues are used to propose new features (e.g. \"Add CSV export feature\" ). Issue descriptions should then elaborate on the title. For feature-level bugs, this may include providing information about how to reproduce the bug; for codebase-level changes, you can name specific files. Assign yourself to one of the issues and add the two issues to the project Kanban board under the \"Todo\" column. You may also want to experiment with adding labels and milestones to your issues. These are all features you will be using in future projects! Branching, Committing, and Pushing \u00b6 On your local machine, create a new branch with a relevant name to the issue you are addressing. Branch Guidelines Branch names should be short and provide a description of what you will be doing on that branch (e.g. \"fix-header-sizing-issue\" , \"fix-multiple-dialog-bug\" , \"add-sorting-feature\" ). When working with others, you can also append your username to signal which branches are yours (e.g. \"313ta/add-sorting-feature\" ). Fix the issue that you were assigned to, then add and commit the changes. Commit Guidelines Commits should start with a verb and provide a description of what they are doing to the codebase (e.g. \"Remove faulty condition from getCustomerDetails\" , \"Fix failing CompositeTestCase\" , \"Fix issue #21\" ). Push the branch to remote by running: % git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name> Writing Pull Requests \u00b6 On GitHub, create a pull request to merge the changes from the branch you have just pushed to the main branch. Warning Make sure you are merging to the main of your own forked repository! By default, GitHub will select the original repository (CMU-17313Q/...) instead of your own forked repository (your-username/...). Give your pull request an appropriate title and description. Pull Request Guidelines Pull request titles should describe what high-level changes were made to the codebase. Generally, they give a concise summary of all the commit messages. Pull request descriptions should describe what changes have been made in more detail and how the changes have been tested. Link the issue you created initially to the PR by using the linking keywords in the PR description, then click on the green \"Create pull request\" button. Notice that the GitHub action workflow runs automatically once you create the pull request! You should check that the relevant test case to your fix now passes. Check GitHub Actions \u00b6 Click on the Actions tab. If you have resolved all the issues correctly, the tests should now pass, and a green check should show.","title":"GitHub Exercise"},{"location":"projects/P1/github/#github-exercise","text":"","title":"GitHub Exercise"},{"location":"projects/P1/github/#overview","text":"The purpose of this exercise is to provide support for students who may be less familiar with Git and GitHub.

Many of these courses use a combination of educational platforms to distribute course materials (handouts, lecture notes, etc), manage student information, assess student learning, and provide a means of communication between the students and course staff. Examples of such platforms include Canvas, Piazza, and Gradescope. However, the distributed nature of this system makes it difficult for instructors to synchronize information across each of the different platforms, and the lack of standardization across the university forces students to remember a different set of links for each class. Your manager has assigned you to a team and has tasked you with building a new course management system over the course of the semester to be used campus-wide. To help manage the scope of this project, they have specifically requested you to focus on implementing the Q&A portion of this overarching system , i.e. the component that enables communication between the faculty and students. Rather than creating a new Q&A system from scratch, management has decided that you and your team will repurpose and adapt the existing forum system provided by NodeBB . Beyond being a pretty decent forum platform, NodeBB provides complex features that you expect will be useful like user registration, permission settings, post creation, sorting and filtering capabilities, and more. Despite its considerable functionality, NodeBB is still missing many of the basic features that you would expect to find in a course-based Q&A system and needs changes to better fit this new purpose. You and your team will be responsible for coming up with an initial development plan and beginning implementation. Deliverables and Deadlines \u00b6 This will be the first assignment with your group. There are three (3) deadlines for this project. Each of the core deliverables are described below. This project is worth a total of 320 points. Detailed information for each of the deadlines has been split into its own subpage on the left. Tip This is a large assignment spanning from now until Spring Break. We estimate that this project will take each student on the team on average 8 hours/week over the next 5 weeks, for a total of 40 hours. We highly recommend reading through the entire assignment before starting so you are aware of our expectations for the later deliverables. To manage all of the write-ups, we recommend saving the pages as a PDF to print or annotate on as you work through the assignment with your team.

You and your team will be responsible for coming up with an initial development plan and beginning implementation.","title":"Project Context"},{"location":"projects/P2/#deliverables-and-deadlines","text":"This will be the first assignment with your group. There are three (3) deadlines for this project. Each of the core deliverables are described below. This project is worth a total of 320 points. Detailed information for each of the deadlines has been split into its own subpage on the left. Tip This is a large assignment spanning from now until Spring Break. We estimate that this project will take each student on the team on average 8 hours/week over the next 5 weeks, for a total of 40 hours. We highly recommend reading through the entire assignment before starting so you are aware of our expectations for the later deliverables.

Use this Slack channel to collectively decide on a team name . Your team name should be unique, pronounceable, short, and something you would be proud to shout in your team cheer on the streets of Doha in the presence of small, impressionable, multilingual children. Once you have a team name, rename your team Slack channel to #team-<teamname> . You can use this Slack channel for subsequent project-team related discussions or specialized Q&A with your CA mentors for the rest of the semester. GitHub Repository \u00b6 You will be working on your team repository for this project. Once you have decided on a team name, go to the link below to set up your team: https://classroom.github.com/a/sDOyL0t5 Warning After you join a team on GitHub, you cannot change teams! Make sure that only one of you creates the team, and make sure that the remaining teammates join the right team. Once you enter your team name, Github will automatically create a repository for your team. You should then create a Github Project board for your repository (you can follow the steps from the GitHub Exercise or the note below). Tip From previous semesters, this guide GitHub Exercise gives more specifics on good issue writing, commit writing and PRs. TAs have created this more recent guide for making good PRs and commits. Setting up a Project Kanban Board and Creating Issues Project boards are a great way to track development. While there are lots of great external tools such as Trello or Jira, GitHub provides their own project boards for us to use with great integration support of their other features. To create a Project Kanban follow the steps below: Click on the Projects tab in your team repo, and then the \"+ New project\" button. This will create a new Project Kanban board directly linked to the team repo. Use the \"Board\" template. Share the Kanban/Project board with your team or make it public so they have access to it. (Even if they have access to the repo, they might not have access to the board initially. To manage access, click on the three dots in the top right and click on \"Settings\" and then \"Manage access.\") Have a team member add an issue for adding team member names to the README into the \"Todo\" column using the \"+ Add item\" button at the bottom of the column. OR under the Issues tab of the team repo, have a teammate create an issue and then link the issue to the Project Kanban board using the \"Projects\" field (two fields below \"Assignees\") on the right-hand side. Specify the status as \"Todo.\" Assign yourself to the issue. You should use this team repository for all your development, and be sure to use good development practices, including keeping your commits cohesive and your commit messages informative. The same resources mentioned above provide more details on our guidelines. We will be grading you on how well you follow the process we used for Project 1 and utilize this Project board: Create issues for feature improvements or bug-fixes When creating issue, assign team members and tag with appropriate labels Create a pull request and reference the issue it will be resolving Provide feedback to pull requests Use a Kanban board to track your workflow For this project, you will create issues or pull requests directly in your team repository . We will use your commit history and issue/pull request activity on Github to assess both your teamwork process and each member\u2019s individual contributions towards the project. It is not acceptable for one person to commit all the work after synchronizing through other means. For each code-based deliverable, we will look at a snapshot of your repository at the deadline. This will often be done by asking you for a screenshot or commit link submitted via Gradescope. Teamwork Self-Assessment \u00b6 As the course moves into team-based projects, we will be releasing weekly self-assessments, each worth one participation point. These are meant to be short surveys and should not take more than a few minutes. They are intended to help you reflect on your team's process and prompt you to think about how to improve it. The first one will be released on Thursday, September 11th and due the following Sunday, September 14th (at 11:59pm). Typically, they will be released on Thursdays and due the following Sunday. Main Deliverables \u00b6 Teamwork Contract (35 pts) \u00b6 When working with a team, it is important to discuss each team member\u2019s background, and establish common expectations of the team. Miscommunication or the general lack of communication are often the most common causes of team conflict. Team Conflict Example A common conflict in working style is when there are team members who always want to get a headstart on their work, while there are team members who are fine with doing work a few days before the deadline. It causes panic in the former team members, while the latter team members feel frustrated as to why they are being rushed. As such, your first process task of the semester will be creating a teamwork contract with your teammates. It is a 1 - 2 page document containing information that all teammates agree to follow. You should work on the contract with all members present . We recommend that you keep it to around 1 page, 2 page is a hard limit. Additionally, it is more important that you only include statements that the team will adhere to than it is to fulfill the length requirement (quality over quantity!) You do not need to write full sentences (bullet points are okay), but your decisions must be clearly conveyed in the document. You are free to include anything that your team deems necessary, but you should minimally address the following sections: Expectations How much time is each team member expected to be putting into working on projects? Punctuality? How would your team accommodate when unexpected commitments come up for a team member (e.g. interviews, sickness, competitions)? Do accommodate for the fact that project load can get heavier towards the end of the semester. Communication What platform (s) will your team be using to communicate? What\u2019s the expected time to get a response? For any communication platforms you decide on, please test that everyone can receive notifications. We highly recommend using apps (Slack, Discord) over browser-based sites. Meeting Schedule When and how will your team meet? What modality would it be? A strong recommendation would be to set up a recurring 1hr meeting blocked out for the rest of the semester, so that your team does not have to scramble to find a common meeting time each week. Teams that have recurring meetings are generally more successful in the class. Responsibilities How will you divide responsibilities for each project? During meetings, who will be in charge of note-taking, organizing & running those meetings? From past courses, we noticed the natural emergence of a project manager in teams, who ensures the project moves towards completion. We highly suggest that you consider how your team would rotate that role amongst team members over the course of the remaining projects. Throughout the semester, we will ask for documentation of your meeting notes, so be sure to keep them organized (we recommend using a shared Drive folder). Equitable Contribution & Conflict Resolution What are the steps the team would take to address teammates who are contributing too little, and when will the team bring this up to the instructors? What are the steps to bring up and discuss potential teamwork issues? The first thing the staff will ask the student when they mention that they are facing team issues is if they have followed the steps on their team contract. Feel free to seek the assistance of TAs and instructors in drafting this document. Note We will ask you to reference, reflect upon, and refine this document throughout this semester, and we will evaluate your team's process strategies and interactions through what you outline in this contract. Please ensure that everyone on your team thoroughly discusses each of the above sections and agree with the final decisions. Once you have completed the contract itself, have all members sign and date the document as an indicator that all members have read the document and agreed to uphold all outlined items. Then, save the file as a PDF and upload it to Gradescope. Only one team member needs to make the submission; they can then add the rest of the teammates as group members for a group submission . We also highly recommend that you bookmark the teamwork contract in your team\u2019s Slack channel. Project Planning (35 pts) \u00b6 Before your team jumps into development, you must first determine what features to implement. Schedule and hold an initial project planning meeting with your team to complete the steps outlined below. Functional Requirements - User Stories \u00b6 During this meeting, discuss potential functional requirements of this project. Consider what possible use cases may be for this system and what features it should have to fulfill those needs. Then, document these functional requirements in the form of user stories that follow the guidelines discussed in lecture. All of your user stories should be in the format of \"As a [role], I want [function], so that [value]\". You should come up with at least two user stories per student in your group. Formulating User Stories Consider what are the different types of users that will be interacting with your system (your stakeholders) and what features they would want to have that the current NodeBB does not provide. You may want to reference features in existing Q&A systems (e.g. Piazza, Diderot) that may be desirable, or conduct interviews with your peers who could be a potential users of this system. As a team, you should then come up with a prioritization ranking for each user story. The prioritization should be based on two factors Impact : how essential is this user story to the overall functionality of the application to your stakeholders, how beneficial it would be to your stakeholders, and Effort : how much time/effort is required to implement this user story Once you have your list of user stories, create a new GitHub Project board (click into Projects on your team repository). Then create two new columns to the left called \"User Stories\" and \"Backlog\" . At this point in time, you should have \"User Stories\", \"Backlog\", \"To-Do\", \"In Progress\" and \"Done\" , in that order from left to right. Feel free to add more columns if your teams decide that you need them during your development process Add your user stories into the \"User Stories\" column using the \u201c+ Add item\u201d button at the bottom, create draft issues for each of your user stories.In the body of each of these draft issues, provide a brief but concrete justification of its prioritization ranking that your team decided on. You should order all the user stories in this column from highest to lowest priority. Technical Requirements - Issues \u00b6 Now that you have your prioritized list, consider the technical requirements of the various user stories and collectively decide on which one(s) you will be focusing on over the next two sprints. In this project (as like most projects), your team is aiming to maximize the amount of value you are delivering to your stakeholders given your constraints. Your selected user stories should have relatively high priority based on your team's ranking, and you should actively take factors into consideration that may impact your development. Selecting Appropriate User Stories Given the amount of variations in each team's user stories, it's hard to give concrete guideline on the number of user stories that a team needs to tackle. Teams could tackle 1 user story that requires major effort, or a few user stories that each requires lesser effort. In general, we are expecting that user stories be selected given: 2 sprints of 2 weeks each number of team members on your team assumption of 8 hours/week available per individual The course staff is happy to discuss this with your team during OH and we highly recommend you do so if your team is unsure. We will also be providing you with feedback during your first sprint's checkpoint presentation . The feature(s) you plan to implement should not be purely cosmetic or arbitrary. We expect this to be a non-issue as most high priority features to make NodeBB usable in a course environment would require changes that span across the development stack. Note An example of what would not be accepted is a cosmetic feature that only modifies a frontend UI component (i.e. changing the color of the navbar), or just the renaming of a field in the database. You may want to look ahead into parts 2B and 2C to check our specific requirements for your implementation. Convert the feature(s) you decide to implement into technical requirements (i.e. what needs to be developed for this feature to work). Then, break these requirements down into manageable, assignable issues and document them on your Project board by adding them to \u201cBacklog\u201d column. At minimum, these issues should make use of GitHub features like milestones/labels/descriptions to denote: Estimated effort for each task Dependencies among tasks (if any) Initial assignments for team members Milestones to indicate which sprint the issue should be completed in (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Stretch) Acceptance criteria that describes how you know this task is done - think about how you will test this feature You should actively assign and move these issues across your Kanban board as your team makes progress. A Note on Grading We will not assess how accurately you predicted your development process, nor will we be giving points based on the complexity or quality of your changes. The focus of our evaluations will be on how you decompose the problem, how you respond to unexpected circumstances, and how you analyze and reflect on your experience later on. We will check your development progress at the end of each sprint. Please be proactive in your planning to ensure that you make notable progress in both of your sprints. We highly recommend reading ahead on what our expectations are for the end of each sprint as you plan your milestone goals. Include a link to your GitHub board in your Gradescope submission. If you are unsure about your planned changes, you can ask for feedback from a member of the course staff! Extra Credit (7 pts) \u00b6 Getting to know your colleagues in a friendly context can often lead to more effective collaboration; for example, healthy teams often get lunch together. To incentivize this, we will give your team extra credit for this assignment if you meet for a team bonding experience outside of a working session. You might want to eat together, go out for boba, or hold a board game session. If someone on your team is not feeling well, you may also do a virtual activity such as an online gaming session (Drawphone, Skribbl.io, etc.) or social \"Zoom lunch\". To receive extra credit, share the photo or screenshot of your team activity with your TA mentors by sending it in your team Slack channel before the deadline. We encourage you to do these types of meetings often throughout the semester! Grading \u00b6 To receive full credit for the teamwork contract, we expect: All sections listed above are addressed in a roughly 1-2 page PDF document submitted to Gradescope Document demonstrates a clear process outline that was discussed between and agreed upon by the teammates All group members\u2019 signatures at the end of the document To receive full credit for the project planning, we expect: A GitHub project board linked to your team repository with: A User Story column containing at least two user stories per group member that satisfy the guidelines outlined in the sections above and in lecture A Backlog column containing a series of GitHub issues describing the feature(s) that the team will tackle.

Once everyone has properly set up the repository on their local machines and committed their changes, you can now start development. You should follow best practices for collaborative development such as using feature branches, pull requests, and code review. Individual changes should be committed to properly named branches for each core feature being implemented and make use of pull requests to merge changes together. A helpful resource for naming commits to practice best habits and make it easier for your teammates to review your code is conventional commits . Consider using this format to ensure your PRs have atomic, well named commits. Tip We highly encourage taking a look at both GitHub Exercise and this (REALLY USEFUL) guide for making good issues, commits and PRs. Be sure to review each other\u2019s code - both from a quality assurance standpoint, but also so you have a better understanding of the codebase. Although code reviews can be done asynchronously, we encourage the first few to be done synchronously so you can discuss the changes with your teammates and learn more about the codebase. Every member of your team must contribute to the implementation. One way we will evaluate this is that each team member must have at least one commit as a part of the solution. Failure to do so will result in a significant penalty to your grade. You must commit all of your changes to the main branch of your team repository before the homework deadline. Unlike the previous assignment, you should not submit your changes to the parent NodeBB repository. Submit a link to your repository and your Github Project board onto Gradescope. For grading, we will take a snapshot of your repository and board right at the deadline and grade based on your progress there. Checkpoint Presentation (45 pts) \u00b6 During the Week 5 recitation slot ( Sunday September 28th ), your group will give a 10-minute presentation describing your current progress, followed by a short 1-2 minute Q&A session where you can get feedback from the TAs and your peers. Your slides should include the following information (the recommended slides amount is in parentheses): Title Slide (1 slide) Include your team name & the names of each team member Project Planning (~1-2 slides) What user stories did your team choose to focus on? What feature(s) did you plan on implementing to fulfill them? Development Progress (~1-2 slides per person) What have you changed so far? How did you test your changes? What have you learned about the codebase? How does this compare with your original milestone goals? If your team did not meet your goals, why? Each team member should describe the contributions they made. In this section, you must include a video demo of your current progress; if you were not able to make a working build, include screenshots that show your current progress and clearly explain what factors impeded your progress. Process Overview (~1-2 slides) What process strategies (i.e. meeting frequency, code reviews) did your team use for the first sprint? Was it effective? Did you encounter any difficulties or have to make any changes? Looking Ahead (~2-4 slides) What are some current risks and/or questions that your team has after completing the first sprint? Has your experience with the first sprint affected your planning of the second sprint? Do you need to rescope? Do you need to reevaluate your process? If you did not meet your development goals, you should outline what you plan to proactively change for this upcoming sprint. A Note on Participation Participation from all team members during the presentation is required. If you are unable to attend in-person, send a Slack message to your recitation TAs with justifications at least 24 hours before the start of your recitation . You will then be permitted to present by submitting a recording of your segment of the presentation, which your teammate will play during the presentation. The presentation slides should be exported into a PDF and submitted to Gradescope by the Tuesday deadline. Grading \u00b6 To receive full credit for the implementation, we expect: Fulfillment of implementation goals as outlined by the planned milestones, or a clearly written justification in the milestone description of why elements fell through An updated Project Board for the current progress Reasonable code structure and style, including documentation where appropriate Coherent commits of reasonable size with meaningful commit messages by all team members High quality usage of Git/GitHub tools, such as issues, milestones, pull requests, and commits To receive full credit for the presentation, we expect: All team members to be present for the presentation (or have contacted their TAs ahead of time to request an absence) and to contribute towards presenting their team\u2019s progress All of the material described above covered in the presentation PDF Slides uploaded to Gradescope for grading & feedback Resources & Documentation \u00b6 NodeBB Development \u00b6 We highly recommend that, before starting development, you take the time to analyze the codebase with your team using the code archaeology techniques you have learned.

Once everyone has properly set up the repository on their local machines and committed their changes, you can now start development. You should follow best practices for collaborative development such as using feature branches, pull requests, and code review. Individual changes should be committed to properly named branches for each core feature being implemented and make use of pull requests to merge changes together. A helpful resource for naming commits to practice best habits and make it easier for your teammates to review your code is conventional commits . Consider using this format to ensure your PRs have atomic, well named commits. Tip We highly encourage taking a look at both GitHub Exercise and this (REALLY USEFUL) guide for making good issues, commits and PRs. Be sure to review each other\u2019s code - both from a quality assurance standpoint, but also so you have a better understanding of the codebase. Although code reviews can be done asynchronously, we encourage the first few to be done synchronously so you can discuss the changes with your teammates and learn more about the codebase. Every member of your team must contribute to the implementation. One way we will evaluate this is that each team member must have at least one commit as a part of the solution. Failure to do so will result in a significant penalty to your grade. You must commit all of your changes to the main branch of your team repository before the homework deadline. Unlike the previous assignment, you should not submit your changes to the parent NodeBB repository. Submit a link to your repository and your Github Project board onto Gradescope.

Your slides should include the following information (the recommended slides amount is in parentheses): Title Slide (1 slide) Include your team name & the names of each team member Project Planning (~1-2 slides) What user stories did your team choose to focus on? What feature(s) did you plan on implementing to fulfill them? Development Progress (~1-2 slides per person) What have you changed so far? How did you test your changes? What have you learned about the codebase? How does this compare with your original milestone goals? If your team did not meet your goals, why? Each team member should describe the contributions they made. In this section, you must include a video demo of your current progress; if you were not able to make a working build, include screenshots that show your current progress and clearly explain what factors impeded your progress. Process Overview (~1-2 slides) What process strategies (i.e. meeting frequency, code reviews) did your team use for the first sprint? Was it effective? Did you encounter any difficulties or have to make any changes? Looking Ahead (~2-4 slides) What are some current risks and/or questions that your team has after completing the first sprint? Has your experience with the first sprint affected your planning of the second sprint? Do you need to rescope? Do you need to reevaluate your process? If you did not meet your development goals, you should outline what you plan to proactively change for this upcoming sprint. A Note on Participation Participation from all team members during the presentation is required. If you are unable to attend in-person, send a Slack message to your recitation TAs with justifications at least 24 hours before the start of your recitation .

After coding is complete, reflect on your experience as a team. Again, we look for honest reflection, which will likely include reflection on failures. We will not grade whether you predicted the effort correctly, but rather what you have learned . You will see the following groups of questions on Gradescope. We recommend that your team use collaborative text editing tools like Google Docs to draft your answers, then submit your final answers to Gradescope. Actual Schedule: Document the actual schedule of your development process into either an organized list or table. You should include all of the tasks that each team member actually performed and the approximate amount of time each took. Your commit history and other documentation should help you with this. Schedule Deviations: Reflect on the differences between your planned and actual schedule, and answer the following questions: Which milestones were predicted correctly and what was re-planned? Was there anything you did not plan for initially or that you had to drop in the end? What were the reasons for the above changes and could they have been foreseen with better planning? Development Process: Reflect on the process (specifically, the steps each team member took to contribute to the codebase) you followed during the project, and answer the following questions: What was the process you initially planned to follow? What was the process you actually followed? Was the process effective? Why or why not? Did you skip steps or adopt additional techniques during the project? What were they and why did you do so? Meeting Minutes: Attach all meeting minutes kept throughout the project, which should include information about the agenda/topics discussed, decisions made, and work assignments. Team Experience: Reflect on your experience working as a team. You should discuss as a team on the aspects of communication, scheduling, responsibilities and equitable contributions. Answer the following points by providing at least three actions that your team will take to improve in the future (feel free to have more than one in category and zero in another, they should just add up to three): What should your team keep doing? What worked well, and why? What should your team start doing? What didn't work so well, and why? What will you do differently? What should your team stop doing? What are some bad habits that your team should avoid in the future and why? Support your claims You should reference your meeting minutes to support your claims and provide examples. A weakly supported statement would be as follows: \u201cWe will communicate better, because miscommunication caused issues\" You should support your statements with examples from the development experience. For example: \"In the future, we will try to use [such-and-such a process] for clearly documenting and communicating such design decisions, rather than [the process we did follow/failed to follow]. One of our [main challenges/development slowdown/quality problems] was the integration of components A and B, because the API for A was not well-understood by the developer of B. \" Teamwork Contract: Based on the process and team reflection above, update your teamwork contract. Did you encounter any issues or unexpected experiences that your original contract did not foresee? Feel free to add in any other clauses if necessary to your team contract. Upload your new teamwork contract (be sure to sign and date it), and highlight the changes you made in yellow. Being able to communicate effectively is an important software engineering skill. As such, your reflection should be well-written and easy to read. Be sure to leave time after writing for revision and proofreading. Reflection Grading One of the main purposes of this project is to encourage in-depth analysis of the reasons for good or bad time estimation, scheduling, and teamwork coordination. Doing poorly in these is not unusual (as numerous reports from real-life projects show). We will not evaluate how well (or badly) the project went, but instead how well you understood the reasons why the project went as it did, and what lessons you drew from your experience to inform your future work. A good reflection document will include concrete statements about lessons learned, with clear supporting evidence, such as examples, to support the claims. Individual Reflection (30 pts) \u00b6 Use of Generative AI Forbidden As described in the syllabus, the use of generative AI tools for this part of the assignment is forbidden, and will be considered to be an academic integrity violation. In addition to the team reflection, you will also be submitting an individual reflection on Gradescope. We want you to connect this project's experience with your previous experience with collaborative development. Your previous experience may be from an academic or non-academic setting, such as internships, hackathons, or personal projects. Your reflection should address the following questions (and sub-questions): What previous collaborative projects have you done before? How does this project experience compare with your previous experience? What was similar and what was different? What did you personally learn from this project\u2019s development process? Process here refers to the steps you took to contribute to the codebase. What did you think worked well? What did you think did not work well? Was there anything unexpected? What did you learn about working in a team? What did you learn about yourself? What did you learn about working with others? What are you planning to do differently or improve upon in your future projects? What would you like to keep doing? Provide at least one concrete action that you plan on acting upon in the next project. Similar to the team reflection task, we will grade the quality and depth of your reflection.

Although you have been testing your new system this whole time, you are now setting out to establish sustained practices that can be used moving forward as you iterate over and continue to improve your system. Your manager has assigned you two major tasks. Firstly, establishing a deployment pipeline to create a test version of the website that can be sent to beta testers who have little to no experience with code development (and therefore can not set up the developer environment by themselves). Secondly, evaluating existing tools and practices beyond simple linting or unit testing, then producing a report on the cost/benefit tradeoffs and risks of them. You will also select and integrate one (or more!) of these tools into your development process. Deliverables and Deadlines \u00b6 There are two (2) deadlines for this project. This project is worth a total of 100 points. Checkpoint Deliverables \u2013 35 points \u2013 due Sunday, October 26th, 11:59pm Deployed Application (25 pts) Tools Checkpoint (10 pts) Final Deliverables \u2013 65 points \u2013 due Sunday, November 2nd, 11:59pm Tool Analysis Design Doc (50 pts) Tool Integration (15 pts) Extra Credit (Individual) - 6 points - due Tuesday, November 4th, 11:59pm Feature Review (6 pts) Checkpoint Deliverables \u00b6 Deployed Application (25 pts) \u00b6 Your team will be using Linux Virtual Machines (VMs) hosted at CMUQ for the deployment of the NodeBB application. Further instructions on how to deploy can be found here . Once you have successfully deployed your website, make sure to test within your team to ensure that your added feature(s) from Project 2 are properly integrated. By the checkpoint deadline you should Submit a link to the deployed site onto Gradescope Add your deployed site to this public spreadsheet , alongside your team name & UserGuide.md that your team submitted for Project 2. This will be used in Feature Review for extra credit. Tools Checkpoint (10 pts) \u00b6 Before jumping into tool integration, your manager would like you to research what existing analysis tools are out there that can be used with NodeBB. You will evaluate the tools, and eventually document your findings in a design document for your final deliverable. First, identify and experiment with at least N potential static and dynamic analysis tools that are applicable to your system, where N is the number of people in your team. We provide a starter list of tools in the resources section below to help you get started, but you are not limited to these tools. In your selection of tools, you should have at least one static analysis tool have at least one dynamic analysis tool have at least one tool that is not from our starter list not use any of the existing tools within NodeBB as part of your analysis (mocha/ESLint/TSLint) For each tool that you assess Create a separate testing branch in your repository (named appropriately for the tool you\u2019re testing) to integrate the tool into your project and test out its capabilities Create a pull request to the main branch from each of these testing branches. The PR should have Concrete evidence that you had successfully installed the tool through trackable file changes demonstrating that extra files/NPM packages were installed. Artifacts that demonstrate that you have successfully run the tool on your repository. Acceptable artifacts include output files generated by the tool, or a text file containing the terminal output from the tool; you may also attach screenshots as additional pieces of evidence. They can be attached to the Pull Request in either the description or follow-up comments. Grading Note We will not be grading the quality or quantity of any code you put into these testing branches/PRs, just the evidence that you have successfully installed and run the tool. In your evaluations, consider & experiment with the types of customization that are appropriate or necessary for this tool, both a priori (before they can be used in your project) and over time. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of each tool/technique, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Consider some of the following questions: What types of problems are you hoping your tooling will catch? What types of problems does this particular tool catch? What types of customization are possible or necessary? How can/should this tool be integrated into a development process? Are there many false positives? False negatives? True positive reports about things you don\u2019t care about? Tool Evaluation There are a lot of different factors to consider when evaluating a tool. We recommend discussing with your teammates and deciding on a group of metrics to focus on when performing evaluations. Time Management Don\u2019t spend too long for this checkpoint. Set deadlines within your team to ensure that you have enough time for both the design document and integration deliverables described below for the final deadline. By the checkpoint deadline, your team will submit your initial list of the N tools that your team plans on exploring, and links to the PRs that demonstrate that you have successfully installed and run each of these tools Final Deliverables \u00b6 Tool Analysis Design Doc (50 pts) \u00b6 Individual Grade Adjustments This document is something that we expect the team to work on together. However, we will be asking who worked on what part of the document, and in the case that a sub-section of the document is low quality AI slop, we will be only penalizing the author of that section, NOT the entire team. To this end, we will be requiring that develop the document in the Google Drive folder that has been shared with your team by your CA. Create a Design Document/RFC that includes: A tools evaluations section detailing your team\u2019s analysis on each of the tools you experimented with A justification section explaining which tool(s) you think the project should use moving forward An integration section describing how the selected tool(s) shall be integrated into your process A conclusion section summarizing your work Below, we provide more detailed instructions and page limit recommendations for each of the sections. Tool Evaluations (~N pages) \u00b6 For each of the N tools explored by your team, you must provide: Name and high-level description of what the tool does and a link to its documentation/source Whether the tool is used for static or dynamic analysis A link to the pull request made from the testing branch for this tool A pro/con analysis of the tool and appropriate evidence in the form of screenshots to support your claims. You can use the questions provided in the research you did for the checkpoint to shape your analysis. Each of these sections should take up approximately 1 page (including screenshots) and no more than 2 pages. Justification (~Half a page) \u00b6 After going through each of the tools, you should explicitly state the tool(s) you are choosing to integrate for this project and provide a justification for why you are selecting this tool. You should refer to the pro/con analysis done in the prior sections and how they align with the goals of your team and the project overall. You must recommend at least one tool , even if it\u2019s with reservations. Integration (<1 page) \u00b6 This section should address the different factors to take into consideration when integrating a new tool. At minimum, you should address the following: Technical Questions How are you integrating the tool (high-level)? At what point in the development/deployment process shall it be integrated? What sorts of customization or configuration will you be using? If you added any specific configuration to allow the main branch of your repository to pass its status checks, add the justification for those decisions in this section. Social Integration Questions How do you foresee the team using the tool during their development process? Consider the incentives & deterrents to the developers when it comes to using the tool, and their personal motivation to use it. Your answers should be based on your experiences running the tools on your team repository and be grounded in data from your research on different factors such as tool usability, output, and customizability. Keep this section updated as you work on implementing the integration. Conclusion (<1 page) \u00b6 In this section, provide a brief summary of your findings along with items that were not addressed in the previous sections. Are there any open questions? Are there any issues you consider to be out of scope? What drawbacks of the proposed process/tooling are you accepting for some (good) reason? This section should be used to wrap everything up and ensure you have a good/complete design document! Submit the Design Document as a single PDF to Gradescope. Tool Integration (15 pts) \u00b6 Once you have a tool selected along with a general integration plan, you should fully integrate one of the tools into your project\u2019s workflow. For your checkpoint research, you should have successfully run this tool locally; you should then create a new workflow within the project to run it as part of the development cycle. Your team should discuss: How often should this new integration be run (on each pull request? on commits to main?) What level of customization is needed for this tool? How should the integration of this tool be enforced? This configuration must have been justified in your design document under the Integration section. To be considered successfully integrated, the tool must: Be merged into your main branch Have been run at least once in the Git flow cycle (i.e. either during the pull request, merge, or commit stage). Pass when run on your codebase. This is indicated by having a green checkmark. Ensuring Passing Checks In order to ensure your checks pass successfully, you may have to make additional changes to your repository, such as fixing reported issues or tweaking tool configuration. These changes should be documented and addressed in your design document. Failing CI builds Continually failing builds show you have not completely integrated the tool into your workflow. On Gradescope, submit a link to your repository and a link to one of the successful GitHub Action runs. Extra Credit \u00b6 Now that you and your classmates have deployed your applications, you will be able to test out each other\u2019s features and provide constructive feedback on your experience and how to improve them! Take this as an opportunity to learn about what your classmates have been working on for the past few weeks. Note that this is an individual task, unlike the rest of project. Feature Review (6 pts) \u00b6 For extra credit, you will conduct reviews of features developed by three other teams' project. Pick three teams's deployment from the public spreadsheet to review, 1 from your own section, and 2 from other sections. For each team, you will submit a review of their feature(s) on the appropriately titled Google Sheet. You will need to test the feature(s) as described in their UserGuide and provide feedback on the following: How was the experience of using the feature(s), would this be something you think would help enable better communication between faculty and students and why? How do you think the feature can be improved? and/or What do you think the feature did well in? Did you discover any bugs using the feature(s)? To qualify for extra credit, you will have to submit your review: on Gradescope in the appropriate sheet for the group you want to review in the public spreadsheet . There should be one sheet per team, and you should add your review to the sheet for the team you are reviewing. Grading \u00b6 To receive full credit for the checkpoint, we expect: A link to your successfully deployed web application for your team repository A list of N different static and dynamic analysis tools, where N is the number of members on your team. This list must satisfy all the following criteria: Contain at least one static analysis tool Contain at least one dynamic analysis tool Contain at least one tool not on our starter list of tools Links to N pull requests for each of the selected tools containing evidence of the tool being run at least once on your repository To receive full credit for the final deadline, we expect: A link to your successfully run CD GitHub action that deploys the website while following proper GitHub practices in handling deployment secrets A design document describing your research into each of the potential tools, justification for your selection of integrated tool(s), and your final integration plan A link to a successful run of a GitHub Action that demonstrates your integration of your selected tool(s) into your team workflow To receive full credit for the extra credit, we expect: Your review of three different teams' features on Gradescope and on the public spreadsheet , addressing the three questions described.

We provide a starter list of tools in the resources section below to help you get started, but you are not limited to these tools. In your selection of tools, you should have at least one static analysis tool have at least one dynamic analysis tool have at least one tool that is not from our starter list not use any of the existing tools within NodeBB as part of your analysis (mocha/ESLint/TSLint) For each tool that you assess Create a separate testing branch in your repository (named appropriately for the tool you\u2019re testing) to integrate the tool into your project and test out its capabilities Create a pull request to the main branch from each of these testing branches. The PR should have Concrete evidence that you had successfully installed the tool through trackable file changes demonstrating that extra files/NPM packages were installed. Artifacts that demonstrate that you have successfully run the tool on your repository. Acceptable artifacts include output files generated by the tool, or a text file containing the terminal output from the tool; you may also attach screenshots as additional pieces of evidence. They can be attached to the Pull Request in either the description or follow-up comments. Grading Note We will not be grading the quality or quantity of any code you put into these testing branches/PRs, just the evidence that you have successfully installed and run the tool. In your evaluations, consider & experiment with the types of customization that are appropriate or necessary for this tool, both a priori (before they can be used in your project) and over time. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of each tool/technique, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Consider some of the following questions: What types of problems are you hoping your tooling will catch? What types of problems does this particular tool catch? What types of customization are possible or necessary? How can/should this tool be integrated into a development process? Are there many false positives? False negatives? True positive reports about things you don\u2019t care about? Tool Evaluation There are a lot of different factors to consider when evaluating a tool. We recommend discussing with your teammates and deciding on a group of metrics to focus on when performing evaluations. Time Management Don\u2019t spend too long for this checkpoint.

AI! Why are we building a Q&A forum without integrating LLMs?!\u201d Once your CEO has finally calmed down, your manager calls an all-hands meeting. At the meeting, everyone agrees that you don\u2019t have the resources to build a completely new Q&A forum and also automate the whole question-answering problem. But, to better compete with Piazza, your CEO and manager decide to put your team in charge of exploring using an LLM to implement a translation feature. This feature will automatically translate posts written in languages other than English into English. This initiative aims to foster inclusivity and ensure that language barriers do not hinder participation in the forum. In light of this new direction, your manager wants you to: Architect the feature - reason about, document and select an appropriate architecture for integrating this feature into the existing system. Build an experimental integration with the existing NodeBB codebase to evaluate feasibility. Evaluate the feature and decide whether the feature should be fully implemented. As everything is just settling down, your CEO bursts back into the room!! There's a new catch: the company is strapped for funding and must be very careful with its spending. As a result, your team is now required to conduct all experimentation and implementation of the LLM-powered translation feature using only the Azure credits currently at your disposal . If your team successfully stays within your available credits and doesn't need to request any more, you\u2019ll earn bonus points for your ingenuity and efficiency. Some of you may think that it\u2019s unfair for this change to come up unexpectedly, especially since we didn\u2019t inform you before P3, but keep in mind that this is just like real life! Working in a company means having to deal with unexpected circumstances, which more often than not contain some aspect concerning money. We're looking to see how well you can adapt to this new situation, and we want you to have this experience before you're dealing with the pressure of real company money. Rest assured, if your team needs more credits to finish the project, we will not be taking off points. Deliverables and Deadlines \u00b6 There are two (2) deadlines for the project. This project is worth a total of 125 points. Checkpoint Deliverables \u2013 65 pts - due Monday, November 11, 11:59pm Architectural Design Document (40 pts) Basic LLM Experiment (15 pts) LLM Experiment Integration Checkpoint (10 pts) Final Deliverables - 60 pts - due Monday, November 18, 11:59pm Tuesday, November 19, 4pm Final LLM Experiment Implementation (30 pts) Evaluation Report (30 pts) Checkpoint Deliverables \u00b6 Architectural Design Document (40 points) \u00b6 To start, your manager has requested a concrete design document outlining how you plan to integrate the new LLM-powered translation feature into the existing codebase. One of your manager's requirements is that this feature should work on a deployed site. If the team decides to go ahead with the feature, this design document will be followed in order to fully integrate this feature into NodeBB. Two initial solutions to consider are: Implementing a Python-based microservice and deploying it as a separate service; then, integrating the service with your existing monolith via a REST API Refactoring part or all of the existing monolith into a microservices-based architecture Your design document must discuss both of these approaches and include a third approach of your choosing . You must advocate for one of these three approaches as the best solution. Once you have finished evaluating the codebase, create the design document highlighting your findings and decisions. Below is a sample outline for your design document along with recommended page lengths. Feature Overview (<1 pages) Describe concisely how the translation feature works and how it will be used by the relevant stakeholders, with screenshots if necessary. Assessing LLM Suitability (<1 page) Use the framework discussed in class to discuss why an LLM may be a good solution for translating posts on NodeBB. Current Architecture (<1 page) Provide a brief description of the current NodeBB architecture. Include an architectural diagram to support your description. Quality Requirements (<1 page) Provide a concise, prioritized list of the overall quality requirements you considered in arguing for the integration of the feature into the system and a short justification for each. Your team should decide on at least three requirements to focus on. Rank your requirements in decreasing order of importance. This allows readers to quickly understand what you were designing for. Potential Solutions (~1 page each) Your team should consider three different potential solutions for integrating the new feature. For each, provide at least one architectural diagram, a brief description of the solution's architectural design, and a discussion of the design's tradeoffs. Tradeoffs must involve (but are not limited to) the quality attributes described in the previous section. Justify such arguments with reference to appropriate diagrams and concrete examples, as appropriate. Selected Architecture + Justification (<1 page) Describe which design your team decided to proceed with in architecturally integrating the feature into existing codebase. Justify your design decisions, including why your design is adequate for the quality attributes important to this system, and what assumptions you made in your design (if any). [!NOTE] Diagrams should involve suitable architectural views ; must include a legend ; and should involve appropriate levels of abstraction for the components in the diagram. If necessary, use color/shape/text to differentiate between types of components and connectors. You may find it appropriate to merge more than one view into a single diagram. If you do this, you must be explicit about what views you are merging , and why. Otherwise, diagrams should clearly represent legitimate architectural views. Make sure that multiple views of the architecture are consistent with each other and the links are clear; if necessary provide a mapping in additional text. [!TIP] Drawing diagrams is much easier with the right software. Consider tools like draw.io (free, online, and collaborative), Dia , OmniGraffle , MS Visio , or even just the drawing editor of Google Docs . Google Slides will also likely work for this purpose. Pictures of whiteboard drawings are also acceptable, if clearly readable. More resources to assist you with creating your design document can be found in the Resources & Documentation section below. [!WARNING] On Generative AI : In the past, students have utilized generative AI tools to generate diagrams with mixed success. While some diagrams have been useful and accurate, others have fallen short due to inaccuracies or oversimplifications not aligned with specific project requirements. Be cautious and review them carefully for accuracy and relevance. If we suspect you've abused generative AI and your diagrams are inadequate , we won't consider regrade requests. You\u2019ve been warned. By the checkpoint deadline, your team will submit your design document to Gradescope as a PDF. Basic LLM Experiment (15 points) \u00b6 To explore the feasibility of LLMs for this task, your manager would like you to prototype the basic functionality of an LLM to translate text. Due to the company\u2019s existing deal with Microsoft, your team will use the gpt-4o-mini language model from OpenAI's Platform. To get setup, you will need to setup your Azure NodeBB instance and set up LLM use through Azure. You should already have done both of these for P3 and recitation 7, but you should refer to these two documents if you don't have something set up properly. Azure Deployment Instructions on setting up NodeBB instance on Azure Recitation 7 Instructions on setting up Azure for LLM use Once you're all set up, open the Colab notebook using this link . Click on File --> Save as a copy in Drive to create your own copy that you will work on. Only one team member needs to do this, and the team should collaborate using this notebook. Click on Share and make sure the Colab notebook is editable by anyone in Carnegie Mellon University. Now, you should be ready to experiment with LLMs! Follow the instructions in the notebook through the end of the Basic LLM Experiment. Given the unpredictable nature of LLM responses, it is crucial to test whether your application can handle a range of outcomes. Your Colab notebook should also include tests for your code. We have provided a starter code. In this task, you are required to employ mocking techniques to test your code resilience against unexpected results from API calls to the LLM. Mocking is a method used in testing to replace real system components with mock objects that simulate the behavior of those components. This approach allows developers to emulate various scenarios, including errors or atypical responses from external services, without having to make actual API calls. Here you will be using mocking to mimic different unexpected outcomes to check if your code can handle such anomalies gracefully. For full credit, your submission should have at least four mock tests that deal with different unexpected model behaviors. At least one of these tests should involve the model returning unexpected text. All tests should relate to the query_llm_robust function. You should download and submit a .ipynb copy of your Colab notebook (with outputs) to Gradescope. LLM Experiment Integration Checkpoint (10 points) \u00b6 For this task, you are expected to have successfully integrated the provided UI code into your project. Additionally, you must implement and deploy a server-side functionality that returns a hardcoded response. This step is crucial to ensure you are on track. We have provided some initial code on this repo . Final Deliverables \u00b6 Final LLM Experiment Implementation (30 points) \u00b6 The final step is to implement this LLM feature into your team's NodeBB project. Your implementation should include the UI code you integrated in Checkpoint #2. You should also integrate the code you developed as a part of the LLM experiment, but you may modify it as needed to successfully integrate the functionality into your code. Because this is the last Project to use NodeBB, commit to your repo, and we will grade your final repository state Reach out to your TA if you have any questions. Furthermore, your server-side code must include unit and mock tests. To accomplish this, you must copy the tests you wrote in the notebook to the repo and integrate them into the CI pipeline. Evaluation Report (30 points) \u00b6 Now that you\u2019ve experimented with an LLM integration, write a report that summarizes your findings for the rest of the team. In particular, you will need to decide whether your findings justify completing and shipping this feature. Your report should include the following with clear headings: 1. Introduction (<0.5 pages) Provide a brief introduction to the LLM integration you\u2019re evaluating, and the context of its use, i.e. the translation feature. 2. LLM integration (<1 page) Describe the end-to-end implementation of your final solution to translating posts. Given an arbitrary post in any language, how do you integrate with an LLM to return an answer? Feel free to include any prompts and diagrams. 4. Evaluation Results (<0.5 page) Provide a summary of the results from applying the evaluation strategy on your final LLM experiment. Feel free to include any evidence/output from your notebook. 5. Operational Costs (<0.5 pages) Based on the pricing of your chosen LLM, how much will it cost to provide users with this feature? How long does it take to translate a post? State any assumptions made in making these estimates. Is the cost associated with providing this feature reasonable? 6. Final Recommendation (<0.5 pages) Provide a final decision on whether the translation feature should be implemented based on the evaluation results, operational costs and other relevant factors. On Gradescope submit the following: Link to your Colab notebook (with output) that contains your code, analysis. Make sure it is editable so that we can run the notebook if necessary. PDF of your evaluation report Grading \u00b6 To receive full credit for the first checkpoint, we expect: An uploaded PDF design document outlining your research into the existing codebase architecture, the quality requirements considered by your team, alternative solutions, and a final justification & timeline for your selected integration plan A link to your Colab notebook completing all of the setup and basic LLM experiment steps outlined by the previous section A functional integration of the UI code into your NodeBB application. A preliminary implementation of the translation feature using the starter code, including CI with unit and mock tests. To receive full credit for the final deadline, we expect: An integrated deployment of your NodeBB and the translation service on Azure. A functional translation feature, as described in your design document, integrated into your NodeBB application and deployed on Azure. An uploaded PDF report discussing your evaluation findings addressing all the sections outlined above Resource & Documentation \u00b6 Design Documents \u00b6 The design document task is easy to underestimate both in terms of time needed and in terms of difficulty designing meaningful and useful descriptions. While it is easy to create a superficial solution, a good solution will likely require significant thinking, discussion, and iteration. Feel free to seek feedback from the course staff on your solution before submission! We recommend that you appoint someone in your team to track the accuracy and completeness of architectural representations throughout this assignment. Do not just divide up the views among your team members and assume they show everything needed. You only need to submit the final designs/documents, not intermediate steps on the process of getting there. There are a few additional reference materials available in the CMU library that your team may want to consult. We do not recommend reading through all of it; instead, skip around to sections that are relevant to you. Software Architecture in Practice, Third Edition : You may wish to review appropriate sections within Part Two to help find appropriate tactics, techniques you can use in your design to promote particular quality attributes.

One of your manager's requirements is that this feature should work on a deployed site. If the team decides to go ahead with the feature, this design document will be followed in order to fully integrate this feature into NodeBB. Two initial solutions to consider are: Implementing a Python-based microservice and deploying it as a separate service; then, integrating the service with your existing monolith via a REST API Refactoring part or all of the existing monolith into a microservices-based architecture Your design document must discuss both of these approaches and include a third approach of your choosing . You must advocate for one of these three approaches as the best solution. Once you have finished evaluating the codebase, create the design document highlighting your findings and decisions. Below is a sample outline for your design document along with recommended page lengths. Feature Overview (<1 pages) Describe concisely how the translation feature works and how it will be used by the relevant stakeholders, with screenshots if necessary. Assessing LLM Suitability (<1 page) Use the framework discussed in class to discuss why an LLM may be a good solution for translating posts on NodeBB. Current Architecture (<1 page) Provide a brief description of the current NodeBB architecture. Include an architectural diagram to support your description. Quality Requirements (<1 page) Provide a concise, prioritized list of the overall quality requirements you considered in arguing for the integration of the feature into the system and a short justification for each. Your team should decide on at least three requirements to focus on. Rank your requirements in decreasing order of importance. This allows readers to quickly understand what you were designing for. Potential Solutions (~1 page each) Your team should consider three different potential solutions for integrating the new feature. For each, provide at least one architectural diagram, a brief description of the solution's architectural design, and a discussion of the design's tradeoffs. Tradeoffs must involve (but are not limited to) the quality attributes described in the previous section. Justify such arguments with reference to appropriate diagrams and concrete examples, as appropriate. Selected Architecture + Justification (<1 page) Describe which design your team decided to proceed with in architecturally integrating the feature into existing codebase. Justify your design decisions, including why your design is adequate for the quality attributes important to this system, and what assumptions you made in your design (if any). [!NOTE] Diagrams should involve suitable architectural views ; must include a legend ; and should involve appropriate levels of abstraction for the components in the diagram. If necessary, use color/shape/text to differentiate between types of components and connectors. You may find it appropriate to merge more than one view into a single diagram. If you do this, you must be explicit about what views you are merging , and why. Otherwise, diagrams should clearly represent legitimate architectural views. Make sure that multiple views of the architecture are consistent with each other and the links are clear; if necessary provide a mapping in additional text. [!TIP] Drawing diagrams is much easier with the right software. Consider tools like draw.io (free, online, and collaborative), Dia , OmniGraffle , MS Visio , or even just the drawing editor of Google Docs . Google Slides will also likely work for this purpose. Pictures of whiteboard drawings are also acceptable, if clearly readable. More resources to assist you with creating your design document can be found in the Resources & Documentation section below. [!WARNING] On Generative AI : In the past, students have utilized generative AI tools to generate diagrams with mixed success. While some diagrams have been useful and accurate, others have fallen short due to inaccuracies or oversimplifications not aligned with specific project requirements. Be cautious and review them carefully for accuracy and relevance. If we suspect you've abused generative AI and your diagrams are inadequate , we won't consider regrade requests. You\u2019ve been warned.

Due to the company\u2019s existing deal with Microsoft, your team will use the gpt-4o-mini language model from OpenAI's Platform. To get setup, you will need to setup your Azure NodeBB instance and set up LLM use through Azure. You should already have done both of these for P3 and recitation 7, but you should refer to these two documents if you don't have something set up properly. Azure Deployment Instructions on setting up NodeBB instance on Azure Recitation 7 Instructions on setting up Azure for LLM use Once you're all set up, open the Colab notebook using this link . Click on File --> Save as a copy in Drive to create your own copy that you will work on. Only one team member needs to do this, and the team should collaborate using this notebook. Click on Share and make sure the Colab notebook is editable by anyone in Carnegie Mellon University. Now, you should be ready to experiment with LLMs! Follow the instructions in the notebook through the end of the Basic LLM Experiment. Given the unpredictable nature of LLM responses, it is crucial to test whether your application can handle a range of outcomes. Your Colab notebook should also include tests for your code. We have provided a starter code. In this task, you are required to employ mocking techniques to test your code resilience against unexpected results from API calls to the LLM. Mocking is a method used in testing to replace real system components with mock objects that simulate the behavior of those components. This approach allows developers to emulate various scenarios, including errors or atypical responses from external services, without having to make actual API calls. Here you will be using mocking to mimic different unexpected outcomes to check if your code can handle such anomalies gracefully. For full credit, your submission should have at least four mock tests that deal with different unexpected model behaviors. At least one of these tests should involve the model returning unexpected text. All tests should relate to the query_llm_robust function.

If you are unable to attend in-person, you have to send an email with justification to the instructor at least a week before your final exam timeslot so that appropriate arrangements can be made. Exceptions to notification deadline will only be made for unforseeable circumstances. The goal of the presentation is primarily to share with the class the project to which you contributed, and your experiences. Your presentation should cover the following topics (the recommended slides amount is in parenthesis): High-level Project Overview (~1 slide) Describe the project in terms of its high-level goals and the context in which it operates. This may include a brief history and the business context. E.g. it may be interesting to note that a project was spawned from a closed-source operation, or that it competes primarily with a closed-source counterpart. Brief Task Description(s) (~2 slides) Brief description of the task(s) you performed, such that the audience has sufficient context to understand your explanation of your experiences. Include a demo of your contribution(s), if applicable. Please do a screen recording of your demo instead of a live demo. We do not expect you to include, for example, any code or diagrams from your report , unless they\u2019re helpful for supporting a point about your interactions with the project. Your Experiences (~1 slides) Summarize your experiences (and what you learned!) interacting with this community of open source developers, focusing on any surprising or unusual aspects of the process or interaction. For example Did you run into any trouble understanding, changing, or contributing to a large, pre-existing project? Were there unanticipated challenges in either implementing your change, or in getting the change submitted to and accepted by the project maintainers? Did the project collaboration process or culture help or hinder your effort in any way? Characterize any interaction you had with the team leadership and community, highlighting especially any useful/useless input you received. You may (but are not required to) also relate the experience from this homework assignment with relevant experience from internships or other projects. Your summary of your experiences can be at whatever level of detail you think is interesting or informative. Given the time limit, selecting and highlighting the one or two most important or interesting observations is likely more useful than trying to be complete. You must upload your slides as a single PDF document to Gradescope by Thursday, December 12th, 11:59pm . Project Report (200 pts) \u00b6 After completing and submitting the modification, write a report about the tasks you have performed. Your report should include: Selected Project (1 paragraph) A brief description of the open source system to which you contributed. You may reuse text from Part A. Project Context and Business Model (<0.5 page) An analysis of the open-source project\u2019s context and business model. This may include a short history of the project, competing open- and closed-source projects, or a discussion of the developers\u2019 motivations to build this system. Essentially, we want to know why this project exists and why it is important. Project Processes and Communication (<1 page) Describe the processes and tools the project uses to coordinate among contributors. For example: Are these processes formal or informal? Provide an explicit description (possibly with a diagram) of the acceptance process used for efforts like the task you completed. If applicable, include standards or expectations regarding software engineering activities including requirements, architecture, and quality assurance; alternatively mention that no such standards exist. Task Description (per task) (<0.5 page) A description of the tasks you have implemented and a high-level description of how you implemented them. Submitted Artifacts (per task) Evidence of the code, documentation, or other artifacts you produced for the task, and evidence that you submitted them to the project. This would likely be links to publicly available resources (repository, email, pull request, etc). QA Strategy (<1 page) Describe which QA activities you performed and justify why you selected these QA activities over others. Describe metrics if appropriate. The justification will likely refer to relevant requirements as well as to the project\u2019s practices. QA Evidence Evidence of your quality assurance activities described above. For example, provide source code or links to source code of tests, provide test protocols, comments or protocols from code reviews, reports from static analysis tools, links to or screenshots from a continuous integration platform, and so forth. Plan Updates (<1 page) A description and justification of deviations between your initial plans and your performed activities (as in Homework 2). Changes are expected, but they should be tracked and explained. Describe changes in scope (e.g., fewer tasks) and in the schedule and work allocation. Provide an updated schedule and note differences. Explain the causes of the changes, such as unanticipated risks. Summary of Final Contributions (<0.5 page) A table that briefly summarizes the contribution(s) each team member made towards completing the task(s). Extra Credit Evidence that your changes have been accepted into the code base of the open source project in forms of links or screenshots. Note: You can also send the merged PR link to the instructors and CAs via Slack over Group DM or e-mail(to all) by 15th Dec 1pm to claim this bonus as well Page limits are provided for guidance; we will not enforce them. Collect all parts in a single PDF document with clear subsections and the names of all team members and submit that file to Gradescope . Individual Reflection & Peer Evaluations (20 pts) \u00b6 Contributions We want to ensure that everyone is participating fully in the final project. For this project, we will be assessing participation in a variety of ways, including: artifact evaluation, self & peer evaluation. Credit due for the team components of this project will be awarded based on evidence of full participation in the team. Partial participation will receive partial credit. Use of Generative AI Forbidden The use of generative AI tools for this part of the assignment is forbidden, and will be considered to be an academic integrity violation. Your individual reflection should include: Self Evaluation Describe the work you have done in this project (e.g. code artifacts, documentation) as well as efforts towards helping your team towards completing this project (e.g. research, organizing meetings, running meetings). Peer Evaluations Describe the specific work each of your team members have contributed towards this project. Describe both tangible (e.g. code artifacts, report & slides making, documentation) and intangible (e.g. organizing & running meetings, communicating expectations) contributions. Do point out teammates that you think are exceptional to work with in this project as well. Teamwork You have been in the same team over the course of this semester (Projects 2-5). Look back on the entire semester and reflect on your team experiences. The following questions may guide you: What has worked, what hasn\u2019t? If you could start 313 or another course over with the same team, what would you change? What have you learned about teamwork and your role in teamwork? (Optional) Do you have any feedback on what we can do next year to help students work more effectively in teams? Bear in mind that the instructor-assigned heterogeneous teams of 3-5 students is non-negotiable. We anticipate problems as part of the learning experience, but would like to avoid unduly frustrating situations. A good reflection document will include concrete statements about lessons learned, with clear supporting evidence, such as examples, to support them.

It is a software development approach that utilizes frequent, automated testing and deployment to ensure that changes to the codebase can be rapidly and safely incorporated into the production environment. Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice of automatically building and testing the codebase whenever new changes are introduced. This involves integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository and running automated tests to ensure that the changes do not break the existing functionality. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) refers to the practice of automatically deploying code changes to the production environment after they have been tested and approved. Continuous Deployment involves automatically deploying changes to the production environment as soon as they pass automated tests, while Continuous Delivery involves deploying changes to a staging environment for further testing and approval before being deployed to production. Together, CI/CD enables software teams to rapidly and safely develop, test, and deploy changes to the codebase, improving the speed and quality of software delivery while reducing the risk of errors and downtime. There's quite a lot to learn about CI/CD. If you're interested in learning more, click here! Task 0: Setting up your repository \u00b6 For this workshop, we'll be working with a basic web app built on Next.js that responds to HTTP requests. Your job during the Extreme Startup game will be to parse these requests and figure out what the correct response is. Today we'll focus on setting up the app so that everything is in place for the game. The steps to do this are as follows: Fork this repo: https://github.com/CMU-17313Q/basic-web-app-f24 . Follow the instructions in the readme to run and test the development server locally.

Your job on Thursday during the Extreme Startup game will be to parse these requests and figure out what the correct response is. Today we'll focus on setting up the app so that everything is in place for the game. The steps to do this are as follows: Fork this repo: https://github.com/CMU-17313Q/basic-web-app .

Task 1: Continuous Deployment \u00b6 To start off, you'll be deploying the app you just forked on one cloud platform - Render. The goal here is to make your app accessible over the internet. You'll also be setting up continuous deployment such that this deployment is updated with the latest version of the app, whenever you push code to the main branch of your repository. Create an account on Render Create a new Web Service Choose \"Build and deploy from a Git repository\" Click on Configure account under GitHub, to give Render access to your GitHub repositories - this is necessary to setup continuous deployment.

Once the deployments are complete manually verify that both support the query you just implemented. Bonus Task: Continuous Integration \u00b6 While the steps above are all that is required for the Extreme Startup game, we'll spend the rest of the recitation setting up CI for our repo as well. For our purposes, we'll set up an action that runs ESLint and our Jest tests whenever we push to the repo. The process will be similar to above. Create a new .github/workflows/test.yml Copy the following into the files and fill in the blanks appropriately! name: __BLANK 1__ on: push: branches: - main jobs: __BLANK 2__: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: __BLANK 3__ steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1 - run: npm run __BLANK 4__ (Run ESLint) - run: __BLANK 5__ (Run Jest) Hint: Look at the readme of the basic-web-app repo!

You will complete online, and not attend recitation in person until week 2. Overview \u00b6 In this course, we will be building on a piece of open source software, NodeBB . NodeBB is \u201can innovative forum software designed to meet the needs of modern online communities.\u201d We will be using NodeBB for the majority of the semester, and we want to start by having you become familiar with the software. You can find an instance of the software deployed at: Class NodeBB Unsecured Website You might see a security warning from your browser when accessing the class NodeBB, since it uses an HTTP (unsecured) connection rather than HTTPS. You can safely ignore this warning and continue, because you will not be entering any confidential and sensitive data on the site. Later in the course, in the software security module, we will discuss in detail what this warning means and why modern systems typically require secure connections. To help yourself become more familiar with the site, we will ask you to interact with it in several ways. Activity 1: Create an account \u00b6 Create a user account using your Andrew ID as the username. DO NOT USE your actual Andrew password . You must use your Andrew ID for us to be able to identify you for assigning participation points. You can then edit your profile to add a \"Full Name\" and a profile picture. Note that the demo site does not have the ability to send emails of any kind, so please remember your password as it cannot be easily reset. Activity 2: Introduce Yourself \u00b6 You should introduce yourself to the rest of the class. Please create a post in the \u201cIntroductions\u201d category, which is only visible once you login*. You should include in your introduction the following info: What you want to be called A picture of you (ideally something that will help people recognize you when they see you in class) in the \"thumbnail\" of the post. A short description (1-3 sentences) about a software project you have enjoyed working on in the past, e.g. during an internship or a large-ish course project. A short summary of why you're taking this course (e.g., because it is a requirement for a specific program and/or because you hope to learn about X). Something that you like to do outside of work, or your favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Feel free to embed photos or links in the post. Activity 3: Reply to another post \u00b6 After you have introduced yourself, you should reply to at least one other introduction post made by someone else, and comment on or ask a specific question about their prior experience or personal hobby. Try using the \"quote reply\" feature (look for the double-quotation marks at the bottom-right of a post) to reply to a specific sentence from their post.

Context \u00b6 Open source software refers to software where the code is openly available, allowing contributors to freely run, modify, contribute, and redistribute the code. These projects provide a great learning experience of working with large codebases to beginner programmers, and give you the opportunity to contribute to software that\u2019s used by a large number of community members. The general criteria for an open source project: - Repository must be public & open to outside contributors - Repository must have an open source license Scavenger Hunt (30 min) \u00b6 Join the slide deck made by your TA for your class and make a copy of the slide for your team. Then, search for open source projects to fill each square in the Scavenger Hunt table. Each project can only count for one square. The goal is to have as many squares filled as possible! While learning about different open source projects, think about what type of projects you would be interested in working on for Project 5. Reflection (10 min) \u00b6 With your team, discuss the following questions: - Which attributes make a good open source project? A bad open source project? - Which projects did you find that you would most like to work on? Which would you least like to work on? Why?

Prerequisites \u00b6 You have a GitHub account You have Git installed You have TypeScript installed You know Git Basics You will be doing the activities as pairs, so be sure to find a partner! Unless specified, each step is to be done by both people. Activity 1a: Forking a repo and adding a collaborator \u00b6 Have either you or your partner fork this repository , then add the other person as a collaborator on GitHub. You can do so by clicking on Settings , then Collaborators Under the General tab in Settings , check the \"Issues\" checkbox in the \"Features\" section to enable the issues pane for your repository Clone the repository onto your local machine Activity 1b: Run a GitHub Action Workflow \u00b6 On Github, click the Actions tab, enable the workflows and select the \u201cLint and Test\u201d workflow Click on the \"Run workflow\" dropdown, then the \"Run workflow\" button (leave Branch to be main ). This runs the GitHub workflow that runs the linter and tests on the project Our GH actions pipeline suggests that the main branch is broken! Let\u2019s walk through the process to fix these errors.

How will you deal with unforeseen circumstances affecting team members (sickness, interviews, competitions)? Activity 2b: Communication and Scheduling \u00b6 Here are some important questions to consider regarding team communication: When will your team meet? Setting aside a day and time to have recurring meetings is an important marker of team success. What platform (s) will your team be using to communicate? How quickly should team members respond? Will you meet in person or through Zoom? What will / will you not accommodate? If a deadline is approaching and there is still work to be done, how will you meet / communicate? Activity 2c: Responsibilities and Conflict Resolution \u00b6 Here are some important questions to consider regarding distributing responsibilities and what your team might do in the case of any conflict: How will you divide responsibilities and tasks between team members? Who will be in charge of organizing, running, and taking notes during meetings ? How will you rotate this responsibility? How will you address any teamwork issues that may come up?

It is a software development approach that utilizes frequent, automated testing and deployment to ensure that changes to the codebase can be rapidly and safely incorporated into the production environment. Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice of automatically building and testing the codebase whenever new changes are introduced. This involves integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository and running automated tests to ensure that the changes do not break the existing functionality. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) refers to the practice of automatically deploying code changes to the production environment after they have been tested and approved. Continuous Deployment involves automatically deploying changes to the production environment as soon as they pass automated tests, while Continuous Delivery involves deploying changes to a staging environment for further testing and approval before being deployed to production. Together, CI/CD enables software teams to rapidly and safely develop, test, and deploy changes to the codebase, improving the speed and quality of software delivery while reducing the risk of errors and downtime. There's quite a lot to learn about CI/CD. If you're interested in learning more, click here! Task 0: Prep \u00b6 For this recitation, we'll be working with a basic web app built on Next.js that responds to HTTP requests. Your job on Thursday during the ~Extreme Startup~ game will be to parse these requests and figure out what the correct response is. Today we'll focus on setting up the app so that everything is in place for the game. The steps to do this are as follows: Warning Do not use codespaces for this task, and the rest of the recitation. Everything must be done locally. Fork this repo: https://github.com/CMU-313/basic-web-app . Follow the instructions in the readme to run the development server locally. Install the Fly.io CLI and set up the Fly.io account that you'll use to host your app. Complete steps 1-3 of the instructions here . In your local basic-web-app repo, run fly launch followed by fly open Now check your fly.io dashboard to monitor your app deployment. This has already been a lot of instructions, so good job for getting this far!!! Note: Fly.io offers a free tier and you should not be required to enter any credit card info for the purposes of this recitation. If you get a message saying that a credit card is required, you can complete the recitation using Vercel instead. See the backup instructions below. Task 1: Continuous Deployment \u00b6 Next, we'll setup CD. Our goal is to set up a GitHub action that links to our Fly.io account and automatically redeploys a new version of our app whenever a new change is pushed into the main branch. The steps to do this are as follows: Get a Fly API token with flyctl auth token . Go to your fork on GitHub and click Settings. Go to Secrets and Variables > Actions and create a repository secret called FLY_API_TOKEN with the value of the token from the previous step. This is how GitHub will link to your Fly.io account. Double check that fly.toml (the config file fly.io uses for deployment) is not listed in your .gitignore . Create a new file .github/workflows/fly.yml .This is the file that will outline instructions for the GitHub action. Fill the file with the contents listed under step 8 here . Commit and push your changes! Now let's take a step back and understand what we've done. First, we generated an authorization token and used it to connect Fly.io to our GitHub repo. Then, we created a fly.yml file setting up a GitHub action that automatically runs the deployment commands whenever a push is made to the main branch. See if you can figure out which lines do what in the code above! Now, look through the codebase and try to change the header on your app's frontend while testing with the local development server. Once you have made your changes, commit and push them. Back on GitHub, you should see the Action trigger and your app will redeploy! With this complete, you'll be able to quickly iterate and any changes you make and push to your fork will be automatically deployed. Cool! Bonus Task: Continuous Integration \u00b6 While the steps above are all that is required for the ~Extreme Startup~ game, we'll spend the rest of the recitation setting up CI for our repo as well. For our purposes, we'll set up an action that runs ESLint and our Jest tests whenever we push to the repo. The process will be similar to above. Create a new .github/workflows/test.yml Copy the following into the files and fill in the blanks appropriately! name: __BLANK 1__ on: push: branches: - main jobs: __BLANK 2__: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: __BLANK 3__ steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1 - run: npm run __BLANK 4__ (Run ESLint) - run: __BLANK 5__ (Run Jest) Hint: Look at the readme of the basic-web-app repo! Note: In an ideal world, you would condition the deployment action on this action, such that your app is only deployed if the linter and tests pass. Sadly, our world is not ideal :(, but if you want to learn more, click here and here ! Once this is complete, you will be ready for the game tomorrow. Good job and good luck!

It is a software development approach that utilizes frequent, automated testing and deployment to ensure that changes to the codebase can be rapidly and safely incorporated into the production environment. Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice of automatically building and testing the codebase whenever new changes are introduced. This involves integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository and running automated tests to ensure that the changes do not break the existing functionality. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) refers to the practice of automatically deploying code changes to the production environment after they have been tested and approved. Continuous Deployment involves automatically deploying changes to the production environment as soon as they pass automated tests, while Continuous Delivery involves deploying changes to a staging environment for further testing and approval before being deployed to production. Together, CI/CD enables software teams to rapidly and safely develop, test, and deploy changes to the codebase, improving the speed and quality of software delivery while reducing the risk of errors and downtime. There's quite a lot to learn about CI/CD.

We'll be going over common team dysfunction issues and discuss mitigation strategies. Context \u00b6 All teams are inherently dysfunctional in some sense. This is inevitable as they are made up of fallible, imperfect human beings, each with different goals and intentions. Thankfully, the causes of dysfunction are both identifiable and curable, but definitely not easy to resolve. Making a team functional and cohesive requires courage, good communication, and a strong resolve to making the team better. Part 0: Preparation \u00b6 We have pre-assigned each team to a set of roles. Have each member of the team choose a role from the options we give you. Keep your role secret from the other groups! We will have the audience guess your roles when your team presents to the class. Part 1: Task Planning Meeting Rehearsal (5 min) \u00b6 Congratulations! Your team has been hired as software developers to work on CMU's graduate school application system. We have assigned each team to a specifc task. Each group's tasks are below. You only have to roleplay your assigned task. As a team, research and find tools that can be used to improve your assigned system. Compare the strengths and weaknesses of the tools. At the end of this activity, your group should have agreed on a tool to use. Be sure to also assign each member a task in order to integrate the tool into your assigned system. Team 1 \u00b6 For your first assignment, you've been asked to develop a better system for handling online payments made by graduate students for their applications. Team 2 \u00b6 For your first assignment, you've been asked to develop a better system for sending acceptances to accepted students. Team 3 \u00b6 For your first assignment, you've been asked to develop a better system for students to log in to their application portal. Team 4 \u00b6 For your first assignment, you've been asked to develop a better system for students to upload documents to their application. Activity Notes: Each member should act as their role during the meeting. Try to fix the dysfunction presented in this meeting and reflect on how you would fix similar issues if they come up in Project 2. Part 2: Presentations! (15 min) \u00b6 Each group will present their meeting to the class (~2 minutes per presentation). The audience will then guess the roles of each of the members of the presenting group. Best group will win a prize! Part 3: Class Discussion (15 min) \u00b6 As a class, discuss the following questions: Were you able to identify the roles played by the other groups? What problems were caused by their behavior? How would you handle these dysfunctional characteristics in future situations? Can you think of mitigation strategies and solutions to avoid these problems? Appendix A: Role Descriptions \u00b6 Below a description of the roles for each number 1-7 and the behavior of each one: The Contributor: You are aiming for general team success. Ask for your team members' opinions often, actively discuss solutions with your team, and demonstrate engagement throughout the activity. The Know-It-All: You think you are extremely experienced and know how to solve all problems on your own. Act like you don't need any help and just tell your team to watch while you search for the tool. Be pushy in telling other members how to search for information about the tool and shoot other members' ideas down. The Silent One: You assume your team members know everything and don\u2019t feel you need to say much. Pay attention to the meeting, but simply do not suggest anything. Remain passive but friendly. The Agreer: You are afraid of raising conflicts and hence decided to just go along with whatever your team decides. Agree with everything during the activity and do not question the decisions of your team. The Hitchhiker: Your goal is to do as little work as possible. Be friendly but not productive. Try to end the meeting as quickly as possible so you can slack off. Get other people to step in for you and take over your tasks. Make fake attempts to make it look like you tried to figure out the task, then pass off the work to someone else. The Flaker: You're interested in the project, but don't want to contribute more time than necessary. Actively contribute to group discussions until tasks are being assigned, then begin giving reasons why you can't contribute more (i.e. busy with interview prep, midterm, or other assignments). If asked to do something else, continue finding other excuses on why you can\u2019t contribute. The Perfectionist: You want this project to be absolutely perfect in even the most minor details. To you, it's most important that the tool\u2019s source code is fully readable, perfectly documented, has a large test suite, and is aesthetically pleasing , and you will argue for or against the tool based on these minor details.","title":"Recitation 6 - Team Dysfunction"},{"location":"recitations/reci6-dysfunction/#recitation-6-team-dysfunction","text":"","title":"Recitation 6: Team Dysfunction"},{"location":"recitations/reci6-dysfunction/#overview","text":"This recitation will give you the opportunity to practice and reflect on the roles you play within a team.

This is an individual activity so everyone should be running the notebook; however, feel free to discuss the activity and your approach with other students! Context \u00b6 You're working as a software engineer at a cruise line company. Your company wants to train a ML model that helps the crew decide who should be given priority to board a lifeboat in the situation of emergency. Your ML engineer decided to train it on titanic dataset, because it's a widely available dataset. He create a model that predicts if a person would have survived in titanic, and if they do, they should be prioritized in the event of emergency. After all, the emergency handling protocol on titanic, the greatest liner of all times, must be fair and effective right? We can use the Titanic dataset to make predictions on whether or not passengers would survive given features in the dataset.

Pre-requisites \u00b6 Basic understanding of how the web works Basic HTML/CSS knowledge Basic JavaScript knowledge Task 0: Fork the repl \u00b6 Create an account on repl.it Fork this repl - you\u2019ll be using this to work through this exercise and see your changes When you run the app you should see something like the below screenshot. At this point, all the static HTML for the todo list has been set up. You\u2019ll be working on making the todo list app function properly using Angular.js Task 1: Setup Angular.js \u00b6 Goal: Convert the basic HTML skeleton in the repl to an Angular.js app Steps: Import the Angular.js library by adding the following script tag to the head component of index.html < script src = \"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.8.2/angular.min.js\" ></ script > Add the ng-app directive to the main <html> tag to specify the root of your app This involves changing the <html> tag at the top of index.html to <html ng-app> Task 2: Data Binding Basics \u00b6 Goal: Display a dynamic title based on user input Steps: Use the ng-model directive to tie the value in the name text input field to a variable in the Angular.js app\u2019s model. Add ng-model=\"varName\" to the name text input tag Include {{varName}} in the Hello here's your todo list string to bind the data in the model to the title in the view Changing the value in the name text field should now change the title in real-time Task 3: Setting up the controller \u00b6 Goal: A boiler-plate controller called TodoListController has been set up in app.js. We want to connect our app with this controller so we can get more control over our todo list Steps: Import app.js by adding the following script tag to the head component of index.html < script src = \"app.js\" ></ script > Change the ng-app directive to bind to todoApp Change <html ng-app> at the top of index.html to <html ng-app=\"todoApp\"> Add the ng-controller directive to bind the TodoListController Change the opening <body> tag to <body ng-controller=\"TodoListController as todoList\"> Now we can access the controller within the body tag using the todoList alias Task 4: Rendering the list of todo items \u00b6 Goal: There\u2019s a list called todos in our controller that we\u2019ll use to store our todo list items. We want to replace the static todo list item with the todo items in this list Steps: Use the ng-repeat directive to render items in the list Change the <li> tag that renders a list item to <li ng-repeat=\"todo in todoList.todos\"> Add the ng-model=\"todo.done\" directive to the checkbox input tag so the checkbox reflects the value in the done field of a given todo list item Replace the static todo list item text with {{todo.text}} to render the text associated with a given todo item in the list Changing the data in the todos list in app.js should now change the contents of the todo list rendered Task 5: Adding new todo items \u00b6 Goal: Allow users to add new todos to the list using the form in the app Steps: Use the ng-model directive to tie the value in the new todo text input field to a variable in the angular.js app\u2019s model Add ng-model=\"todoList.todoText\" to the add new todo here text input tag Implement the todoList.addTodo function in app.js Add a new todo item to the list using the data in todoList.todoText Clear the text input field by setting todoList.todoText to the empty string Add the ng-submit directive to the form to call this addTodo function on submit by changing the opening <form> tag to <form ng-submit=\"todoList.addTodo()\"> Task 6: Special styling for completed todo items \u00b6 Goal: We want to apply custom styling for completed todo items, so they appear crossed out Steps: A CSS class called done-true for completed todo items has been implemented in style.css . Make any changes you\u2019d like to this CSS class Apply this class to the todo text item Change the <span> tag used to render {{todo.text}} to <span class=\"done-{{todo.done}}\"> Checking a given todo item should lead to the custom css class being applied to that item","title":"Recitation 2 - Angular.js and MVC"},{"location":"recitations/archive/reci2-angularjs/#recitation-2-crash-course-in-angularjs","text":"","title":"Recitation 2: Crash Course in Angular.js"},{"location":"recitations/archive/reci2-angularjs/#overview","text":"This recitation aims to highlight the basics of Angular.js by walking students through the implementation of a basic To-Do list app. Students will be expected to use this knowledge to make changes to the Angular.js components of the Teedy project in a future assignment.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"recitations/archive/reci2-angularjs/#pre-requisites","text":"Basic understanding of how the web works Basic HTML/CSS knowledge Basic JavaScript knowledge","title":"Pre-requisites"},{"location":"recitations/archive/reci2-angularjs/#task-0-fork-the-repl","text":"Create an account on repl.it Fork this repl - you\u2019ll be using this to work through this exercise and see your changes When you run the app you should see something like the below screenshot.

NOTE: you should be able to do this by adding tocolab to the github url for the model_testing notebook. Make sure to connect to google drive and upload the titanic data set folder to your drive, double check the file paths in the notebook to make sure they match Overview \u00b6 During this workshop, students will have the opportunity to play with various machine learning frameworks and tools and justify a recommendation argument for using a machine learning model in practice. This is an individual activity so everyone should be running the notebook; however, feel free to discuss the activity and your approach with other students! Context \u00b6 You're working as a software engineer at a cruise line company. Your company wants to train a ML model that helps the crew decide who should be given priority to board a lifeboat in the situation of emergency. Your ML engineer decided to train it on titanic dataset, because it's a widely available dataset. He create a model that predicts if a person would have survived in titanic, and if they do, they should be prioritized in the event of emergency. After all, the emergency handling protocol on titanic, the greatest liner of all times, must be fair and effective right? We can use the Titanic dataset to make predictions on whether or not passengers would survive given features in the dataset. We trained two models on the data: one that uses sex as a feature and one that does not. You\u2019ll be working with the starter code in model_testing.ipynb. Activity 1: Examine the Titanic Dataset (10 mins) \u00b6 The dataset contains detailed information on the passengers aboard the Titanic. Go through the first part of the testing notebook. Then choose one feature and plot its distribution. Is the distribution what you expected it to be? Was there anything surprising about it? Activity 2: Import and Analyze Models (5 min) \u00b6 We pre-trained two models based on the Titanic training dataset. Let's import these models and review their accuracy. Note that the difference between the models is one uses sex as a feature and one does not. Run the cells in this section. Activity 3: Fairness Metrics Evaluation (15 mins) \u00b6 An important part of evaluating an ML model is assessing its fairness. In this activity, evaluate the fairness metrics that we discussed in class with respect to sex and pclass. 1. Fill in the notebook to compute the demographic parity metric 2. Fill in the notebook to compute the equal opportunity metric 3. Feel free to evaluate and compute any other metrics that you think would be helpful to evaluate the model. One to consider is true and false positive rates and/or true and false negative rates. Activity 4: Recommendation (10 mins) \u00b6 Based on the analysis and evaluations we've done above (both fairness and accuracy), would you recommend that one of these models is used in practice by the cruise line company? Justify your choice with evidence that you produced in previous activities. Feel free to write directly in the jupyter notebook and then add your answer to the gradescope quiz.","title":"Workshop - Machine Learning"},{"location":"workshops/ml/#machine-learning-workshop","text":"","title":"Machine Learning Workshop"},{"location":"workshops/ml/#setup-instructions","text":"Go to this repo and clone it Make sure you can run the jupyter notebooks The preferred way is to run it locally.
