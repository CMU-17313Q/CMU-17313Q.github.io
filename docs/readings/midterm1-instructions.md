# Midterm 1

## Overview

As we have our midterm scheduled for Sunday, October 6th, complete the exams from past years listed below and come to recitation this week with any questions!

**Note: As we have not yet covered software engineering for ML this semester, please ignore those questions. The SE4ML material will not appear on the exam.**

## Cheat Sheet

You are allowed to bring one double-sided A4 cheat sheet to the exam. You must submit your cheat sheet along with your exam. If you handwrite the cheat sheet yourself, you will receive **bonus points**. Printed cheat sheets are also permitted for use.
