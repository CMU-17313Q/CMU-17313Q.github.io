# Project 2C: Collaborative Development

## Deliverables

Second Sprint – 140 points – due Thursday, March 2nd, 11:59pm

- [Process & Implementation Final Snapshot](#process--implementation-final-60-pts) (60 pts)
- [Team Reflection](#team-reflection-50-pts) (50 pts)
- [Individual Reflection](#individual-reflection-30-pts) (30 pts)


## Process & Implementation Final (60 pts)
Continue working on the implementation of your feature(s). Be sure to continue following best practices for collaborative development similar to the previous sprint.

As you become more familiar with the codebase, we have higher expectations for the final deliverables of this sprint. Specifically, along with your feature changes, we expect to see:

- **Automated Tests**
    - Add tests to the test suite that demonstrate the functionalities you implemented
    - These should follow the acceptance criteria you set from the initial planning

- **User Documentation**
    - Create a new file `UserGuide.md` in the root directory of your repository
    - In this file, provide a detailed outline of how to use and user test your new feature(s)
    - You should also provide a link/description of where your added automated tests can be found, along with a description of what is being tested and why you believe the tests are sufficient for covering the changes that you have made

!!! note "GitHub Actions"
    GitHub Actions should be enabled. It is reasonable to have failures in feature branches, but you should do your best to make your main branch build consistently pass.

As with the first sprint, every member of your team must contribute to the implementation. One way we will evaluate this is that each team member must have at least one commit as a part of the solution. Failure to do so will result in a significant penalty to your grade.

You must commit all of your changes to the main branch of your team repository before the homework deadline. Unlike the previous assignment, you should not submit your changes to the parent NodeBB repository.

Submit a link to your repository and your Github Project board onto Gradescope. For grading, we will take a snapshot of your repository and board right at the deadline and grade based on your progress there.


## Team Reflection (50 pts)

After coding is complete, reflect on your experience as a team. Again, we look for honest reflection, which will likely include reflection on failures. We will not grade whether you predicted the effort correctly, but rather what you learned from the process. You will see the following groups of reflection questions on Gradescope:

- **Actual Schedule:** Document the actual schedule of your development process into either an organized list or table. You should include all of the tasks that each team member actually performed and the approximate amount of time each took. Your commit history and other documentation should help you with this.

- **Schedule Deviations:** Reflect on the differences between your planned and actual schedule. Which milestones were predicted correctly? What was re-planned? Was there anything you did not plan for initially or that you had to drop in the end? What were the reasons for the changes? Could they have been foreseen with better planning?

- **Process:** Reflect on the process you initially planned to follow, and the process you actually followed. Was the process adequate? Effective? Did you skip steps or adopt additional techniques during the project? How could the process be improved if you had to do another, similar project? How might you have to change the process to adapt to a different type of project?

- **Team Experience:** Reflect on your experience working as a team. What worked well? Were team meetings efficient? How well, and through which processes, did you communicate? What needs improvement? Were there any teamwork challenges you resolved as the project progressed?

- **Meeting Minutes:** Attach all meeting minutes kept throughout the project, which should include information about the agenda/topics discussed, decisions made, and work assignments.

- **Teamwork Contract:** Reflect on how your team interacted with regard to your teamwork contract. Did you encounter any issues or unexpected experiences that your original contract did not foresee? Based on your answers, take the time to discuss with your team, then update and upload your new teamwork contract (be sure to sign and date it). Briefly discuss any changes that were made (if any).

!!! note "Reflection Grading"
    One of the main purposes of this project is to encourage in-depth analysis of the reasons for good or bad time estimation, scheduling, and teamwork coordination. Doing poorly in these is not unusual (as numerous reports from real-life projects show). 

    Therefore, we will not evaluate how well (or badly) the project went, but instead how well you understood the reasons **why** the project went as it did, and what lessons you drew from your experience to inform your future work. A good reflection document will include concrete statements about lessons learned, with clear supporting evidence, such as examples, to support the claims. 

!!! note "Good Reflection Practices"
    It is a good idea to reference your meeting protocols to support your claims and provide examples. For example, “We could have communicated better.” is weakly supported. One could strengthen it with examples from the development experience as follows: “One source of [defects/development slowdown/quality problems] was the integration of components A and B, because the API for A was not well-understood by the developer of B… In the future, we might try to use [such-and-such a process] for clearly documenting and communicating such design decisions, rather than [the process we did follow/failed to follow].”

Being able to communicate effectively is an important software engineering skill. As such, your reflection should be well-written and easy to read. Be sure to leave time after writing for revision and proofreading.

There are many convenient tools for collaborative text editing; for instance, the course staff used Google Docs for this homework document. We recommend using these tools to draft your answers; then, submit your final answers to Gradescope.


## Individual Reflection (30 pts)

In addition to the team reflection, you will also be submitting an individual reflection on Gradescope. Specifically, we will ask you to reflect on the process, scheduling, and teamwork, and connect this project experience with your previous experience with collaborative development. Your previous experience may be from an academic or non-academic setting, such as internships, hackathons, or personal projects.

Your reflection should answer the following questions: 

- What previous collaborative projects have you done before? How does this project experience align with your previous experiences? What was similar? What was different?
- What did you personally learn from this project’s development process? Was there anything unexpected?
- What are you planning to do differently or improve upon in your future projects? What would you like to keep doing?

Similar to the team reflection task, we will grade the quality and depth of your reflection.

## Grading
To receive full credit for the implementation, we expect:

- [ ] **Progress from Interim Snapshot**
    - [ ] Fulfillment of implementation goals as outlined by the planned milestones, **or** a clearly written justification in the milestone description of why elements fell through
    - [ ] An updated Project Board for the final progress
    - [ ] Reasonable code structure and style, including documentation where appropriate
    - [ ] Coherent commits of reasonable size with meaningful commit messages by all team members
    - [ ] High quality usage of Git/GitHub tools, such as issues, milestones, pull requests, and commits
- [ ] **Additional Requirements for Final Submission**
    - [ ] Automated test cases for the implemented functionalities
    - [ ] GitHub Actions running on the repository and passing on the main branch
    - [ ] Created `UserGuide.md` file containing user documentation of the new feature that fulfills the guidelines given above

To receive full credit for the reflections, we expect:

- [ ] A detailed, well written, and well structured reflection on each of the provided guiding questions
- [ ] A comparison between the planned and the actual schedule
- [ ] An analysis beyond mere descriptions and superficial statements, including supporting evidence for claims, that reflects on the causes of deviations, conflicts, and so forth, or your own experience
- [ ] Inclusion of meeting minutes(s) that adequately demonstrate your team’s meeting process
