# Project 4: Software Architecture & ML Evaluation

## Learning Goals
- Design a software architecture for software system that incorporates machine learning
- Decide the appropriate architecture for a given problem
- Assess and describe the tradeoffs of different architectures
- Integration of machine learning into a software system and reason about their implications
- Evaluate the performance and fairness of machine learning models
- Engage meaningfully with engineering ethics

## Project Context 
As you and your team continue developing the new system, your CMU contact suddenly bursts into the room shouting, “Careers! Hiring! Machine learning!”

Your manager follows closely behind and provides an explanation: a significant number of job recruiters have taken interest in your project and would like to use the platform as a means to reach out to students for career opportunities. However, the population of students is too large, and increasing annually. They are concerned at the sheer number of students to review for job applications, and recruiters want a simpler way to narrow the applicant pool. While your team had been working on the service, your buzzword-enamored clients had hired another engineer to work on an extra ML-based feature to take in student performance data and provide a prediction of which applicants are more likely to succeed.

However, the engineer left shortly after and the project was abandoned. They have left an unfinished draft pull request on the repository, and you have been tasked with completing the project.

Your manager wants you to:

1. Assess the current architecture, and decide what's the best way to incorporate the work done by the previous engineer.
2. Reason about, document and select an appropriate architecture for the project.
3. Finish to re-integrate the feature made by the other team based on your team's new design

At the same time, given the nature of the project of evaluating students, you are also concerned about the fairness of the model. You have been tasked with:

1. Evaluating the pre-trained model's performance and fairness
2. Writing a report on the evaluation of the model
3. Provide a decision on whether the model should be used in production
